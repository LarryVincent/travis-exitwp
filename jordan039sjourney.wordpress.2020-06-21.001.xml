		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She let a giggle escape as she slid her fists together. I raised her elbow to line up with her ear and the giggle erupted into an outburst of laughter. Her knees went soft and she lost her stance. I looked over at her baseball coach who was laughing himself. Her laughter was infectious. It was hard to get serious with her.<br /><br />&ldquo;OK, Jordan, &rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hit the ball out of the park.&rdquo;<br /><br />She had wriggled around in her outburst so much that her feet were pointing in the wrong direction. I gently turned her ankles toward the batting tee. This, of course, prompted more giggles. I steadied her by resting my palm on her back. She raised her arms with the bat against her shoulder. Her coach placed the ball on the tee. She took no time at all to swing the bat  and connect. There was no power in it, but the ball flew cleanly up the middle dropping to the ground just behind the pitcher&rsquo;s mound. I cheered her but quickly stopped when I noticed that she was standing there with me, both of us admiring her ball.<br /><br />&ldquo;Run, Jordan. Run.&rdquo;<br /><br />She disappeared down the first base line, helmet bobbling on her tiny head, a plume of giggles tracing her route. Jordan had scored her first base hit.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />To be perfectly honest, I never thought she would make it to the plate, much less first base. She&rsquo;s never been interested in athletics, although she does enjoy snuggling with me while I watch a ball game. I call her my baseball girl because I can always count on her to warm my lap (and usually fall asleep) while I take in an Angels game. But previous attempts to get her playing sports resulted in disappointment. A year ago, I signed her up for soccer and agreed to coach her team. Midway through the season she decided that the best part of soccer was snack. She stood in the center of the playing field crying while girls raced around her. We let her end the season early, a sacrilegious act in our family, and warned her that if she signed up for another sport she would be required to see it through. I figured that was the end of her athletic aspirations.<br /><br />But then, sometime around November, she declared that she was going to play baseball. Jeanette and I reminded her of the soccer experience, but she always responded, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s alright. I want to play baseball.&rdquo; I&rsquo;d look at Nettie. She&rsquo;d look at me. We&rsquo;d both look at Jordan who always stood smiling, an aura of resolve about her. I usually responded with sarcasm, the memory of coaching a team that was supposed to include my own child lingering. &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t expect me to coach,&rdquo; I&rsquo;d say.<br /><br />When time came to register for the baseball season, I sat her down and gave a lecture. I told her how important it was to serve the team. I told her that the team relied on her to play. I told her that, just like fighting cancer, half the battle in sports is perseverance. When I&rsquo;d finished my oratory, I let a moment of silence accent the gravity of the message. Jordan furrowed her brow. Her eyes hungered for understanding.<br /><br />&ldquo;I really want to play baseball, Daddy.&rdquo;<br /><br />How do you say no to such an honest plea for participation?<br /><br />Saturday, watching her run a scrambled beeline up the base path, I was glad to have relented. She was having fun. She was applying herself. Maybe this was a self-prescribed component of her own recovery plan. Maybe she wanted to wear a uniform and practice the baseball ritual. Maybe she just wanted to feel the joy of hitting a ball with a bat. Whatever her reason, it felt good.<br /><br />It was a big day for our family. Not only did Jordan hit her first single (she connected for another single later in the game), Lucas surprised us all with his own playing development. It&rsquo;s amazing what a difference a year will make. Baseball has always been his favorite sport, but sometimes his playing ability and his passion were arms length apart. Saturday, he went 3 for 4 with an RBI. He played catcher for an inning and blocked the plate courageously. In the outfield, he backed up every play, hustling to cover his teammates with a seriousness I&rsquo;d never seen before. This was the boy who often played in the dirt while runners rounded the bases. No more. He barely cracked a smile on the field. He was a gamer through and through.<br /><br />But the moment Saturday that caused me the greatest pride derived from the subtlest of actions. Two of Lucas&rsquo;s teammates from last year played for the opponent. In the third inning, one of those former teammates scored a triple. Lucas was playing third base. When his friend tagged up and settled on the bag, I noticed that Lucas gave him a pat on the lower back. There was no great attention called to the act. Neither boy looked at the other. No small talk or horseplay,  just a mature acknowledgment from one friend to another of a job well-done. It was a proud moment on a day that bestowed abundant pride and a sense of accomplishment for our family.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-6712646014834650645?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She&rsquo;s eccentric; the kind of girl who one day might wear satin jumpsuits to cocktail parties. She carries herself with a bubbling coolness, a contradiction of temperament. One moment she is detached as a Japanese dowager, the next vying for the gasp of an audience. Some might label her dramatic. She&rsquo;d probably agree. She relishes exhibition. She moves animated, flittering in a flattened world, pushing her will upon it with an infectious charm, a large part of why I love her.<br /><br />It has been nearly five months since Jordan was diagnosed with cancer, and the disease is distant from her - a log line in her life story, seldom more. Her illness wafts around like a familiar scent, rarely intruding upon her life. She is matter-of-fact about it, leaving the high drama to more mundane crises: denial of sweets, manipulation of her brother, trivial playground bruises.<br /><br />But the scent of the disease lingers. It irritates reality when we pause, thinking it benign. Thankfully, it does not threaten health. Our daughter blushes forceful will over life&rsquo;s testing challenges. Her illness surfaces in ghostly forms, like a random software bug.  She stammers over familiar words, forgets conversations, teeters with misplaced observations. Sure, she is smart. It is her intelligence that renders error immediate. She over-compensates to conceal mistakes. Her eyes feign sovereignty. She puts her back into false assertions. It is once noble, inspiring and sad. And I can&rsquo;t help but love her more. She reminds me of a modern day Mame Dennis. I imagine her twenty years from now, a character none can comprehend, full of life and contradiction; never sweating the big things, sounding crescendos on nuances the rest of us overlook.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />Of the members of our family, none weather change better than she. In these past few months change has been abundant. Cabana Group closed its doors. I began a new career and have spent nearly every week on the road. We sold our home and moved into a new apartment. Virtually every part of our lives is different. Jeanette, Lucas and I have each grappled with the depth of change, erupting in outbursts of emotion, occasionally isolating ourselves with guarded defenses, and often binging on indulgent pleasures. But Jordan is unaffected. She sleeps sound. She accepts each change with practical rationality. Auntie Mame&rsquo;s motto rings true in her spirit: life is a banquet and most poor sons-of-bitches are starving.<br /><br />People often ask me how we deal with Jordan&rsquo;s condition. They search my eyes for signs of vulnerability. Or they scramble to find the right thing to say. They project themselves into my life and shutter at the thought of their child stricken with serious illness. Most assume the worst. Who wouldn&rsquo;t? But to sit in Jordan&rsquo;s presence is a lesson in the mind-boggling crossword puzzle of life. You can&rsquo;t converse with her and not imagine a grown lady with an indomitable presence. Her spirit is bigger than the room that encloses it. At times trying, at others intensely gratifying, she commands with eyes that win you over. Her petite bean-pole of a frame chasses delicately about only to pirouette and turn on you with agile strength. She has the mettle of a CEO, or a diplomat, or celebrity. She has the character of a survivor.<br /><br />I am daily inspired by the girl that is my gift. You can&rsquo;t feel sorry for her. She won&rsquo;t let you.<br /><br />When I was a teenager, a friend bought me a copy of Patrick Dennis&rsquo;s book. I read it with glee several times. I still have it. The binding is worn and the pages are brown and brittle. Last week, in the midst of our move, I dusted it off and skimmed it for old time&rsquo;s sake. Once again, I laughed out loud. I lost myself in the whimsy of Auntie Mame&rsquo;s world, thinking it something from another era; thinking the story as dated as the battered copy on my bookshelf. But then I realized Mame is alive and well. She lives in Jordan.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-8613478552347037006?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three months have passed since Jordan was diagnosed with cancer, and most people have no idea there&rsquo;s anything wrong with her at all. The hair has grown back around the area of her surgery, concealing the crescent scar behind her left ear. The color has returned to her skin and her eyes are full of life. She giggles, jumps, climbs and colors, just like other kids. It is easy for all around her to dismiss reality. She seems so healthy. Even when we administer her chemotherapy before bedtime, we do it with complacency. It&rsquo;s just a few pills, we think as we spoon her 60mg of temazolamide - a drug so powerful that we are cautioned to wear gloves while handling it, and the pharmacist must special order it days in advance.<br /><br />An eery normalcy has crept into our lives. It sedates us with false comfort that is occasionally disturbed by bursts of reality. Our little girl is 6 years old and in kindergarten. She cannot read. Words that she once recognized on first sight are now foreign to her. Where once she could write her name plainly, now she struggles to scribble letters barely recognizable. She mistakes &lsquo;n&rsquo; for &rsquo;d&rsquo; and '4&rsquo; for 'u&rsquo;, a phenomenon so strange no one seems able to explain it. Perhaps if she was not battling a brain tumor we would calm ourselves with the old adage that every child develops on their own timeline. Perhaps if we had not watched her master  studies a year ago, we&rsquo;d rationalize that she was just a slow learner. Instead, we are anxious and apprehensive, afraid to talk about what we observe out of fear that our worries will cement into permanent fate. <a name="more"></a><br /><br />Make no mistake, Jordan is bloody brilliant. This is a child who has always read a room clairvoyantly and developed a strategy to work it in the blink of an eye. Even today, in spite of her reading issues, she has a keen ability to recall minute details of things she has observed. She processes information rapidly and operates under a logic that Socrates would have admired. But her speech center is often affected, making her sometimes sound like her tongue has taken a nap or that she might have stolen a sip of brandy. And she struggles with written words and letters.<br /><br />The situation is further complicated by Jordan&rsquo;s will. She was born under the sign of Leo and unbridled determination has always set her apart from other children. She can be fearless and incorrigible. She has never liked to do anything unless she could absolutely master it. She was a late walker. Despite our pleas and encouragement, when we stood her up, she&rsquo;d set back down and crawl. Then, one day she stood up and started walking. We were stunned. She did the same with speech. Few words, only the basics. Then, out of the blue, she began stringing sentences together with cunning skill. She has a strong Irish pride, and that&rsquo;s what worries us now. She avoids trying to do her homework or attempting to read books with us. Instead of taking her time and sounding out the letters, she just makes up sentences of her own to describe the pictures she sees. We try to slow her and focus her upon the sounds, but she avoids the subject. We cannot tell if this is a behavioral issue - more of Jordan&rsquo;s desire to do things on her terms - or a symptom of her illness. And so we worry.<br /><br />Like any parent, we want the best for our children. We want them to reach their highest potential and make a dent in the world. When Jordan was born, I looked into those ravenous blue eyes of hers and saw a future leader. I realize that sounds far-fetched. How could anyone look an infant in the eyes and see anything but a helpless, pink baby? I can&rsquo;t explain it. She had the eyes of a leader. Her spirit was strong. And for that reason, Jeanette and I chose a name that offset Jordan&rsquo;s gentle feminine frame - a strong name - a name no one would ever mistake for a willing follower. There&rsquo;s no doubt my child is strong. She has battled her disease with guts and gusto. But I fear she is being lobotomized. I am often reminded that the body of a child is remarkably resilient. Specialists lecture me on the inexplicable ways in which the brain re-wires itself after injury or impediment. But these factual comforts do little to lift my spirits.<br /><br />If only she would read. Such a simple thing, really. Yet, if only she would string a few words together I would sleep through the night.<br /><br />My own ambition and pride color my motives. I worry that she will fall behind in school, become a special education student. I curse and mumble on about how unfair it is. Then I feel hollow for feeling shame and doubt. I pound my fist against the table out of frustration. Then I take a more resourceful tack. I spend time with Jordan, helping her do homework or reading her a book while trying to trick her into saying the printed words. She&rsquo;s on to me quickly and I get no satisfaction, only more frustration. In her company I cannot help but feel that inside her pretty little head rests the whispers of God. But they are trapped there, hindered by cancer and the race of time.<br /><br />This will sound silly, but my wish for the coming year is simple: let Jordan read. I suppose I should hope that her cancer shrinks by 50% or that she needs no further surgery. I&rsquo;ve already reconciled with the fact that fighting her disease will take time. I have patient expectations with regard to the progress of her treatment. But I hunger for her intellectual recovery. My daughter has the potential to live up to the profound words of  Queen Elizabeth I when she said &ldquo;I know I have but the body of a weak and feeble woman; but I have the heart of a king, and of a king of England, too&rdquo;.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-5705187424911477348?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was the smallest tooth I&rsquo;ve ever seen. Jordan held it proudly in the palm of her hand. It was a long-time coming, this one. Lucas began losing his baby teeth at five, but Jordan has been stingy with hers. 2:45 pm was the exact time of separation, duly noted by her kindergarten teacher. Poetically, she marks this rite of passage on the same day as another milestone in her life: the final day of her first chemotherapy cycle.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />The lost tooth was no surprise. On Monday, she told us that one of her teeth &ldquo;wiggled.&rdquo; We cheered and teased. By Tuesday, the tooth was so loose it nearly waved good morning. Jordan was apprehensive.<br /><br />&ldquo;Is it going to hurt?&rdquo; she whined as she slicked her tongue back and forth over the errant denture.<br /><br />&ldquo;No, honey. It&rsquo;s just going to fall out and then your gum is going to feel kind of funny&hellip;but it won&rsquo;t hurt.&rdquo;<br /><br />Jeanette and I were sure she&rsquo;d come home from school that afternoon with something to put under her pillow, but she and the stubborn tooth returned in the same precarious relationship. Only now, the tongue twisting was constant. When she wasn&rsquo;t talking to you, her tongue danced around her teeth like it had a mind of its own. It made Jeanette and I so uncomfortable we kept concocting ways to hasten the big moment.<br /><br />&ldquo;Have an apple, sweetie,&rdquo; Jeanette suggested.<br /><br />But Lucas, the ever-eavesdropping man-about-the-house, uncovered the ruse.<br /><br />&ldquo;Yeah, Jordan. That&rsquo;s how I got my tooth out. You just eat an apple.&rdquo;<br /><br />Jordan&rsquo;s face twitched into a frown.<br /><br />&ldquo;No! It&rsquo;s gonna huurrrrt!&rdquo;<br /><br />Resisting the urge to smack Lucas on the back of the head, we sent him to his room to finish his homework. We had somewhere to be. Tuesday night was the Holiday Pageant for Jordan&rsquo;s kindergarten class. She was excited. She wore a favorite green velvet dress with holiday ribbons. This was a big night. And there she stood, looking quite the picture of Christmas personified in a little girl, a Norman Rockwell character painted in sepia tones &hellip; all the while twisting her tongue about her face grotesquely swinging a loose tooth on its hinge.<br /><br />Throughout the lively holiday performance the loosening continued. Then, she started looking down at her feet. While the other kids sang on cue and presented their best holiday smiles, Jordan fumbled around in her spot, shuffling on the floor. We were sure the tooth had lost the battle. On the stage, with fifty other children and an auditorium crowded with parents, the tooth must have fallen out, we thought. Then she started to cry. It was a brave cry. She tried not to let it interfere with her performance. She&rsquo;d make little sobs and brief frowns, then she&rsquo;d stiffen up to belt out the next verse of the song while wiping tears away. We had three songs to go and she was melting down. And we still could not determine the whereabouts of the wayward tooth.<br /><br />As it turns out, when the last bow was taken and the children returned to their waiting room, we found our little girl with all her teeth still intact. She had been crying because she couldn&rsquo;t see her grandmother in the crowd. I tucked her into bed that night and then informed the tooth fairy that she could skip our house again.<br /><br />42 days have passed since Jordan began her first chemotherapy cycle. She&rsquo;s been so cooperative, never complaining. Each night, she helps us mix the medicine into the apple sauce. Then she eats it all dutifully. The side effects have been minimal. The progress unknown. But now she can look forward to two weeks of rest before beginning the process again.<br /><br />42 days. And on the 42nd day, the last of the protocol, her body gave her something to mark the occasion. It did so without any fanfare, without any drama - just plopped the tooth right out onto her desk. Her teacher helped Jordan put it in an envelope, labeled 2:45 pm. Jordan brought it home with a new sense of confidence and ease. She had navigated a rite of passage. She was a bigger girl. And for that, we had two reasons to celebrate last night. The tooth took center stage, of course. She placed it under her pillow hours before bedtime, and she slurped her last dose of apple sauce laced with Temodar quickly so she could rush to sleep in anticipation of rewards from the tooth fairy. Jeanette and I prayed for a different  reward as we turned the light out and whispered good night.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-8167129683822481818?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The big blonde kid, number 9, smashed through our middle line. I think they called him Riley. He was unusually tall. A parent from the sideline joked that he drove himself to the game. He was fast, too, though he didn&rsquo;t look it. He sped past our center and fixed his sights on our goal. Our defenders, only two in range, scrambled into position. My eyes swept the field in search of support. Our center scrambled to catch the attacker, but he was yards behind with little hope of gaining. That&rsquo;s when I noticed my son surging forward, angled on a path to intercept racing number 9.<br /><br />I don&rsquo;t know why I was so surprised. He had long since graduated from daisy picker to average player, but his performance was a constant source of frustration. All season long he lollygagged and socialized. He had a habit of standing around when he should have been running or hustling on the play. Two games before, I warned him to display more effort. I reminded him that a team is only as strong as its weakest link. He nodded understanding, but the next week he once again meandered through the game, spending more time cracking jokes with fellow teammates than contributing to the mix of competitive play.<br /><br />He wasn&rsquo;t meandering now. He was bearing down with ferocious determination. Number 9 spotted him and broke right to throw him off, but my boy countered with an easy course-correction. Attacker and defender danced. I looked on with hesitant, suspicious hope. Any minute now, I figured, he would lose steam and the attacker would continue on. But the boy was unrelenting. He spun on the attacker, tackled the ball and kicked it out of bounds. The sidelines cheered him. So did I. He spied me applauding his play, but he made no acknowledgment. Instead, he thrust himself into the game and helped his team secure a spot in the semifinals. It dawned on me that he was due far more credit than I had given him. I am proud of him. Not because of his play, or his effort, or even his development as a soccer player. These are small achievements in the scope of what he&rsquo;s navigated in life. I am proud of him because his character always rises in the face of adversity. Truth be told, Jordan&rsquo;s journey has an unassuming hero. His name is Lucas.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />Last night he fell asleep laying cross-wise on his bed. He likes to sleep that way. The difference on this night was his face, which was covered by a leather fedora. He&rsquo;s going through an Indiana Jones phase, and he wears the hat constantly, spending hours in his room swinging a makeshift whip attempting to lasso the doorknob. When he&rsquo;s not practicing for adventures yet to come, he passes time on his computer or sketching comic books of his own design. It&rsquo;s all very peaceful and productive until his sister enters the room.<br /><br />Jordan adores her brother. She adores him so much that she makes a point of inflicting herself upon him whenever she can. Try as hard as she might to leave him alone, she just can&rsquo;t help herself. She bosses him. She sasses him. She pesters him constantly. He ignores her until she can no longer be ignored. Then he explodes in fits of bitter annoyance. She seems to take great satisfaction from the emotion she can conjure from him. It usually takes Jeanette or I to restore the peace. The front quiets and then minutes later we&rsquo;ll hear them giggling. Perhaps Lucas has finally secured the makeshift whip to the doorknob and they take turns swinging on it. The door bangs against the wall, chipping paint and reverberating through the flat. Again a parent intervenes, this time to restore safety to the household. The pattern repeats &ndash; a quarrel, then a party &ndash; like it does in just about any house with school-age children. Lucas and Jordan are at once an inseparable and an insufferable pair.<br /><br />But throughout her illness, Lucas has been an anchor. When she was in the hospital, she asked for him constantly. She beamed when he came to visit. He was a motivating factor for quick recovery. She wanted to go home to be with her brother.<br /><br />Lucas is likewise affected, but he is stoic. Though born and raised in Southern California, his family&rsquo;s farmers&rsquo; roots run deep. He is reluctant to spend much time analyzing feelings. He grows restless when discussing Jordan&rsquo;s situation. He&rsquo;d rather discuss baseball, or schoolyard conversations, or scientific discovery, or anything that doesn&rsquo;t flirt with the gravity of cancer. The night before she was to undergo surgery the first time, he revealed how deeply he felt about his sister as I tucked him in for bed. All day long I&rsquo;d tried to prepare him for what was to come, soliciting his feelings. I was honest with him. He was quiet, reticent to make eye contact with me, eager to drift off into some idle conversation. But as I leaned in to kiss him on the forehead, his emotions finally escaped.<br /><br />&ldquo;Dad, I&rsquo;m scared for Jordan.&rdquo;<br /><br />His eyes flooded and he hugged me, sobbing. He couldn&rsquo;t speak. I couldn&rsquo;t either. I didn&rsquo;t know what to say. So we just held each other in the dark, both of us afraid, feeling helpless. When he finally fell asleep, I rolled him onto his pillow and stood near his bed for what felt like a very long time. We weren&rsquo;t so different, we two. We both like to fix the things we can and ignore the things we can&rsquo;t. But there was no way to ignore how we felt about Jordan. There wasn&rsquo;t much we could do to fix her, either.<br /><br />Jordan&rsquo;s recovery is due in large part to her brother. He is an ally she relies upon for strength and rejuvenation. They are sometimes friends, sometimes adversaries, sometimes conspirators against their parents. He has never once given her any reason to be afraid. He challenges her and supports her and often cheers her on. Though there are plenty of times when he&rsquo;d rather she just leave him alone, he&rsquo;s always there when she needs him. In her life, Lucas can always be counted upon to run down the field and chase challenges to the sidelines. She views him as a brave and sometimes bothersome hero, worthy of his cowboy hat and always good for adventure.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-3529977032679202027?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It feels diabolical. Before you break the capsule, you have to put on latex gloves. The contents are toxic. When it splits open, the poison snows out in a powdery dust that quickly disappears into a marsh of apple sauce. The best way to  conceal any hint of  the drug&rsquo;s bitter taste is to throw in a dash of  candy sprinkles. Once added, the mixture stains from pale yellow to electric blue. Although it&rsquo;s a doctor-prescribed treatment, the scene plays out like a chapter from a dime-store crime novel &ndash; scheming in the kitchen, a twisted, deranged parent poisons an evening snack to quietly finish off a child. But this is a different sort of master plan. It is Jordan&rsquo;s nightly dose of healing, a chemotherapy dessert.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />The drug is Temozolomide,  approved by the FDA in August, 1999. Sold by Schering under the brand name Temodar, it is specifically designed to treat patients with certain forms of brain cancer. It is administered orally and it acts on DNA in the cells of the body to affect cellular growth, suffocating cancer cells while passing over normal cells. You may never have heard of Temodar before, but thousands of children with astrocytomic brain tumors are regaining health thanks to its innovative design. In a recent study reported in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, 61% of patients responded to treatment with the drug, and few patients showed any signs of toxicity. (FYI - Jordan&rsquo;s oncologist is a co-author of the study.)<br /><br />The true beauty of Temodar is its relatively low incidence of side-effects. It usually does not cause hair-loss. Nausea, another common by-product of chemotherapy, is also rare. But this drug, like all drugs, comes with risk. Chemotherapy can take a toll on the body&rsquo;s immune system. That&rsquo;s why Jordan returns to the hospital every two weeks for lab work and exams. The doctors look for any signs that her immune system might be weakening, paying close attention to her white blood cell count. I&rsquo;m happy to report that Jordan&rsquo;s Irish blood seems more than fit for the challenge of toxic drugs. She is half-way through her first chemo cycle and her blood counts are robust.<br /><br />Only time will tell whether or not Temodar will reverse Jordan&rsquo;s cancer. The doctors advise patience. They warn us not to be discouraged if we see further tumor growth in the months ahead. Temodar works slowly. We&rsquo;ll monitor her progress in follow up MRI scans, the next one scheduled a few days before Christmas, but no one expects to see much change then.<br /><br />Think of Jordan&rsquo;s story like a slow-moving war epic. Inside her body, three armies engage on a sprawling battlefield. The army of cancer slowly and methodically usurps innocent tissue, while a rebel army of insurgent white blood cells  and a band of mercenary  Temodar troops  join forces to stop the invaders. The allies are an unlikely pair. Like Celtic tribes of old, they sometimes knock one another off, but their combined strength is indeed a powerful resistance. Progress is not always apparent on the battleground, but the proof rests in the smile of the precocious child on the outside, crunching sprinkles in her apple sauce.<br /><br />Now for the plug: Temodar is one of many drugs made possible by ongoing clinical research. As the holiday season approaches, please join us in contributing to the efforts of researchers all over the world. Private funding from organizations like the Lance Armstrong Foundation  and St. Jude Children&rsquo;s Research Hospital  make advances in cancer treatment possible. You can help, too, by giving them your support.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-1755548127785328849?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;Read &lsquo;Red, but Not So Dead&rsquo;,&rdquo; Lucas begged enthusiastically.<br /><br />It is the title of an article about the discovery of methane gas on Mars. He chomps on a wedge of &ldquo;sunrise quesadilla&rdquo;, a breakfast he requested; tortilla grilled with cheese and scrambled eggs. He half-stands in his chair, one knee bent upon the seat while the other straddles the floor. It is his normal dining posture, though it drives his mother crazy.<br /><br />Jordan sips her tea, nods approval, then adds her own request.<br /><br />&ldquo;Yah, then read the one about the cranberries.&rdquo;<br /><br />It is Tuesday, and our breakfast is a feast of discovery. Tuesdays are when the New York Times publishes Science Times. We read it together, serving reports of innovation with a side of bacon.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />I am raising scholars, though I am due little credit. They enjoy learning, and it is of their own free will. It would take all my effort to slow their progress. I am the beneficiary. I learn a lot by following them on their journeys. Like today, I learned methane gas can be created by bacteria, and if bacteria is causing methane to build up on Mars, perhaps life exists on Mars. Who knew?<br /><br />Lucas thrives on stories of astronomy and exploration. Any article featuring the stars, planets or the far-reaching universe receives his vote for first-in-line recounting. The stories that deal with the universe within &ndash; our bodies, disease, cellular anatomy &ndash; make him uneasy. &ldquo;That story freaks me out,&rdquo; he will say. But Jordan is less discriminating. She enjoys being read to, and finds a bit of interest in all the topics. She retains obscure pieces of information from the stories, then springs them when we least expect. One day on a car ride across town, she said she didn&rsquo;t like it when the monkeys get sick. I had no idea what she meant, so I asked her. After a few minutes of obscure conversation I finally realized she was referencing a story we had read in Science Times, about monkeys used in clinical trials who were  exposed to disease.<br /><br />Today, at Jordan&rsquo;s request, we read a seasonally-appropriate story on the cultivation of cranberries. Evidently, she learned about cranberries in her kindergarten class.<br /><br />&ldquo;Cranberries grow in the water &hellip; on a bog,&rdquo; she says.<br /><br />She climbs on my lap and oogles the color photographs that accompany the story; bright red berries clustered in circles floating on a shallow bay. I am bolstered by her interest and her classroom recollection. Last week, we met with her teacher for parent-teacher conference. Jordan is doing so well. Though she continues to struggle with some fine-motor skills, her cognitive abilities are back at full-steam. We were relieved to learn that she is progressing normally. She loves going to school, loves her teacher, loves her class. Apparently, all three love her, too.<br /><br />Lucas zones out a bit during all the talk of berries. He wants me to move on to a story about intentional flooding of the Colorado river in the Grand Canyon. An accompanying photo shows torrent jets of water firing from the base of the dam. I have to admit, it looks pretty cool. Jordan listens in for a moment, then finishes her tea and dons her Mary Janes. It&rsquo;s time to stop reading and finish our morning, hair to comb, teeth to brush, backpacks to stuff. We gather at the door ready to face the Tuesday. Jeanette ushers them down the hall to the minivan while I pack my laptop. From the distance, I hear Jordan exclaim, &ldquo;cranberries grow in Massachusetts.&rdquo; She mangles the name of the state and Jeanette corrects her. She tries again, and improves a little. I think to myself, &ldquo;you go, girl.&rdquo;</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-4554840929659832502?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Normal is what you make of it. That which seems  boring and sedentary to one human being might summon adrenaline in another. Though nothing in our life is as it was a little over a month ago, a feeling of normality has returned to our family. The days are over-saturated with activities. The kids quarrel, then play, then quarrel again. And Jordan&rsquo;s indomitable personality holds court upon our house as it has for more than six years. Life at the Vincent homestead feels eerily uninterrupted. Little would anyone know that we have joined a secret society, leading alternative lives.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />We didn&rsquo;t choose to join the Society. It chose us. Within hours of Jordan&rsquo;s hospitalization the first members  sought us out. They offered comfort and counsel through emails, phone calls and personal visits. They were survivors themselves, and they welcomed us to a community of survivorship. They warned us that life would change, but they advised us to be strong and to store up ample quantities of hope and faith. We were too busy coping with Jordan&rsquo;s condition to pay much attention to the Society. We thanked them and thought to ourselves, &ldquo;how nice, but we don&rsquo;t qualify for membership.&rdquo;<br /><br />Membership in the Society changes your perspective. It forces you to face menacing fear while unearthing the roots of beauty and aspiration. All the while, you imagine that it&rsquo;s all a big mistake. You reason that you are hysterical, that your membership application was proffered erroneously. Like an AARP invitation that arrives when you&rsquo;re only 49, you argue that it&rsquo;s too early to settle into this new phase of life.<br /><br />Accepting your status begins the healing process, for in that moment of decision you allow yourself to belong. For our family, the healing process truly began when Jordan returned to the hospital to begin chemotherapy. But it was not the drugs or the exam with her physicians that started the process. It was time spent in a crowded oncology ward, mingling with other parents and children in the Society. Surprisingly, despair was absent. A bright-faced boy, not more than 10 years old, challenged wary opponents to a game of Nintendo. His gallant brown eyes lit up the room as he laughed when lesser-skilled brethren succumbed to his digital dexterity. Never far behind was his IV canister, dripping his  chemical cocktail in a slow, steady rhythm. Life surrounded this child with resilience and effused like vapor.<br /><br />It was this scene that  welcomed Jordan into the Society. It didn&rsquo;t matter that she was about to be poked and prodded, examined and excused. She wanted to sit at the crowded table and get her hands deep in play-dough. While waiting for her appointment she created a painting in the art center and cooked a faux dinner in the toy kitchen. When it was time to visit the doctor, she begged us to bring her back to the playroom when the exam was finished. And when we returned to the hospital two weeks later, the elevator couldn&rsquo;t travel five floors fast enough. She ran to join her mates in the Society&rsquo;s main meeting lounge. It was then that we realized that she is neither afflicted nor affected. She is a member. Her life is to play, to learn and to trust in the promise of the future. In this pursuit, she is not alone.<br /><br />I realize that it has been some time since I last updated you on our family&rsquo;s journey. No news is generally good news. Our family is healing and coping with distractions that thankfully have nothing to do with cancer. I promise to post again soon.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-6446618106707852137?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to take it off!&rdquo;<br /><br />Jordan ran to a corner, arms folded, crocodile tears streaming down her face. In the opposite corner, Jeanette and I did all that we could to suppress laughter. Jordan clutched her right forearm defiantly. A crusted, dingy sliver of translucent adhesive tape dangled near her finger tips. It was a stowaway from her hospital stay. It once held the IV tubing in place, but now it stuck to her arm like a vestigial organ, its only purpose to collect bits of dirt and grime. Jordan refused to take it off when we left the hospital. While she loves the application of bandages, she is recalcitrant about their removal. After all she&rsquo;d been through with surgery and a cancer diagnosis, we decided to wait and let her take the tape off when she felt ready. Then two weeks passed. We needed to draw the line. The darn thing was just not hygienic.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />Clutched in her other hand were a pair of safety scissors. She was determined to snip the bandage into tiny bits. She wanted no help. Sobbing dramatically while wielding the scissors with her left hand, she nipped at the tape futiley.<br /><br />&ldquo;Would you like Daddy to try and cut off the part that&rsquo;s already off?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Nooooooooo!&rdquo;<br /><br />More sobs. More drama. More aimless nips with the safety scissors. We stayed in our chairs, not wanting to lose her trust or cause her any more anxiety. So much of what we were seeing was forced. A false move by one of us would only prolong the performance. Then, Jordan betrayed herself. Her eye caught a glimpse of a wrapped lollipop on the dining room table. The eyes dilated and fixed on the waiting treat.<br />&ldquo;Maybe I should eat my lollipop. Then I&rsquo;ll feel better,&rdquo; she whined.<br /><br />&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s such a fair trade,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t taken off the bandage. You can have the lollipop after you take the tape off.&rdquo;<br /><br />She groaned and shuffled her feet. The corners of her mouth turned down with grim determination. The wheels in her head were turning so fast you could hear them. She didn&rsquo;t want to allow us any satisfaction. This was to be on her terms. A few minutes passed as she grasped the arm again, lest we should sneak up on her and take the tape off ourselves. We remained seated. After several minutes, the whines subsided and her body language changed.<br /><br />She tossed the scissors onto the table and grasped the free end of the tape. Part of it separated cleanly, with little resistance. She let out a prolonged grunt. It came from the pit of her stomach, guttural and determined.<br /><br />&ldquo;Alright! You did it. Take the rest of it off.&rdquo;<br /><br />We chanted and cheered like the crowd of a sporting club. One small piece, not more than an inch, clung to her arm with defiant resolve. She was reluctant to challenge it. She picked at it with her index finger, then cried as it provided apt resistance.<br /><br /> We encouraged. We reasoned. Meanwhile, the lollipop beckoned.<br /><br />After a few moments of indecision and  aggida, she went at it again. She tried to outsmart the sticky opponent, grabbing it from the other side. But the tape was on to her ruse and it stuck fast. Angered by the stubbornness of her foe, and no doubt tired of waiting for her lollipop, she grasped the loose end and yanked.<br /><br />For three seconds, the room was deathly quiet. The tape lay still on the carpet. Its lifeless body shriveled upon itself, its edges coated in black dreck. Jordan stared at the corpse in silence for a split second, then let out a scream.<br /><br />&ldquo;Oweeeeeee!&rdquo;<br /><br />Jeanette and I jumped to our feet. We had a code blue. Jeanette moved into apply compression to the pink skin of Jordan&rsquo;s wrist. I ran to the refrigerator to grab an ice pack. Together, we attended to the patient&rsquo;s physical and emotional trauma. Jordan pouted briefly until she remembered the lollipop. In no time, the wrapper was off and it&rsquo;s purple surface disappeared into her mouth. The whining and the sobs became more sporadic. I scooped up the dead adhesive tape and disposed of it quietly. Jeanette hugged Jordan who concentrated on the grape pacifier.<br /><br />I stood back and admired my daughter. After a week of near normalcy, the last evidence of her hospitalization was gone. Returned was her vibrant, precocious personality.  She was back to school, back to her ways, back to life. Though the journey is only beginning &ndash; she began chemotherapy this week &ndash; I find great repose in these moments with her. Life springs from inside her with determination and color. She conquers challenges big and small in pursuit of rewards we often trivialize: laughter, costuming, candy. She&rsquo;s a remarkable testament to willpower.<br /><br />As I waxed deep in my thoughts, I heard Jordan call to her mother.<br />&ldquo;Mommy?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Yes, honey.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I think I need a band-aid.&rdquo;</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-1570318511760466432?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jordan will return to school on Monday. It won&rsquo;t be soon enough for her. Saturday morning she whined while sitting at the breakfast table, &ldquo;why can&rsquo;t I go to school today?&rdquo; An explanation of weekday mechanics did little to pacify her, so she ran off to get some &ldquo;homework&rdquo;. Of course, Jeanette and I plan to use this episode to our advantage in later years, when it is possible that her academic enthusiasm might wane.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />The human brain deserves more respect and awe. Most of us take it for granted. Jordan&rsquo;s recuperation is a decisive testimonial on the merits of the compensatory nature of our internal wiring. Whereas a week ago she could barely color in the lines, yesterday she was sketching patterns with her crayons and adeptly coloring her menu at the local restaurant where we lunched. To regain her artistry she put herself on an intensive course of self-directed physical therapy.<br /><br />Jeanette explained to me how Jordan did it. Wednesday morning, Jordan sat in our atrium and quietly colored page after page. She practiced making fine, controlled motions with her hands. With relaxed wrists and a delicate grip, she sketched arching strokes and simple textures  in random, disorganized  patterns. If there was a blank spot of paper, she colored it. Looking at the pages now, I recognize that each is an abstraction - a coterie of colors and lines that have no meaning or definition on their own. Yet, viewed as a whole, there is indeed a picture: a picture of recovery.<br /><br />What&rsquo;s most fascinating about this behavior is that Jordan came up with it on her own. She didn&rsquo;t give us much explanation about what she was doing. She was a sphinx.  She occupied herself for hours at a time, leaving a trail of multi-colored construction paper in her wake. Sometimes she would ask Jeanette to help her. Jeanette would cradle her wrist and the two of them would tackle a color book together. Her focused activity bordered on obsessive compulsion. But it seems to have achieved its purpose. The neatly colored artwork adorning our refrigerator is its testament. In the process of recovery, she is a better colorer today than she was before this all began. And the pride of her accomplishment beams from her face. If I didn&rsquo;t know better, I would swear Jordan was from Missouri. She needs to see for herself that she is getting better. All the coddling and positive reinforcement from mom and dad is fine and well, but nothing beats seeing results.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-5405547723449246626?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A Mirrored Pool of Thought</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At age 14 Sylvia Plath wrote, &ldquo;How frail the human heart must be &ndash; a mirrored pool of thought.&rdquo; Years ago when I read this I thought it a deep sentiment for an adolescent. Watching Jordan struggle with her own mirrored pool of thought this week, the poem found new meaning.<br /><br />Physically, Jordan is recovering well. She adeptly moves around the house, only occasionally needing to balance herself. She appears to have less visual impairment. Nearly gone is the one-eyed squint she adopted when watching television or focusing on an object for awhile. Her appetite is back and she&rsquo;s singing again.<br /><br />Yet recovery requires more than physical recuperation. Jordan struggles with her own thoughts.  Sometimes, she is troubled by her mind&rsquo;s misperceptions. The brain is a delicate organ. It will take time for her internal CPU to finish the reboot process. The experience is often frightening for her. She is reluctant to share this fear. But occasionally it wells up and pours out of her in revealing statements &ndash; statements adults would struggle to shape themselves. For example, tonight, as I lay beside her, she said to me, &ldquo;I miss me.&rdquo; <a name="more"></a><br /><br />Make no mistake, Jordan is getting better. Jeanette and I whisper sentiments of gratification to one another throughout the day. We relish hearing  Jordan string improvisational lyrics together on our atrium patio again. Her fine motor skills are improving at a fast pace. She&rsquo;s coloring again. Our little girl is returning to us, and we love it.<br /><br />For all her improvements, sometimes she just gets blue. I suppose it&rsquo;s important to remember that she is haunted by three interlocking traumas. First, there is the physiological trauma of the surgery. Only time will heal this wound. Our brain tissue is our cognitive memory bank. When it is disturbed, how we see the world is literally affected.<br /><br />In addition to the real, physiological side-effects, Jordan is also dealing with post-operative emotional trauma. She&rsquo;s been through a lot. It was undoubtedly scary. It probably hurt. And on top of it all, she was drugged out of consciousness for nearly four hours.<br /><br />Finally, she&rsquo;s processing the fact that she must fight a life-threatening disease. However well she may have handled the news, a diagnosis of cancer must be every bit as hard for a child to process as it is for an adult. When she is melancholy, I&rsquo;m certain a part of it is connected to her diagnosis. I think to myself how scared I would be. I have no idea how I would react, and even less of an idea of how I would perceive it with the eyes of a child. This must explain why she&rsquo;s having nightmares and raising concerns about &ldquo;bad things&rdquo; in her head.<br /><br />Watching Jordan go through this is agonizing. We do everything to keep her spirits up. 90% of the time we are successful. But there is that 10% of the time where nothing we say or do can lift her. It is probably healthy to let her go through those moments of sadness and emotion, but knowing this doesn&rsquo;t make it comforting. I have faith that in time, this too will pass.<br /><br />She had trouble falling asleep tonight. I picked her up and we danced slowly as I sang some of her favorite songs. She requested &ldquo;Baby Mine.&rdquo; I started the song, crooning with my best lounge voice. Her arm wrapped around my neck. After a few lines, she patted my back with her hand. I recalled how she would do this when she was just an infant and I wondered who was comforting who.<br /><br />Baby mine, don&rsquo;t you cry.<br />Baby mine, dry your eyes.<br />Rest your head close to my heart, never to part, baby of mine.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-3166134574667791749?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am very superstitious. Truth. I cross my fingers, knock on wood and stay quiet in winning streaks. When I&rsquo;m writing a new piece of fiction, I never discuss it with anyone for fear that the idea will be jinxed. So forgive me for prefacing this journal entry with a disclaimer: it is still early and our family is learning to take one day at a time. That said, Jordan is showing signs of improvement. She was far more animated and alert today. Up until today, there&rsquo;s been a little less sparkle in Jordan&rsquo;s smile, a shallow depth in her expression and a distance in her eyes. All of these symptoms are subtle. Only those who know her would perceive the deficit. Today, it began to dissipate.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />She slept a lot. So did Jeanette. The two ladies let their bodies recuperate. The difference was apparent. Jordan played with her friend, Indu. She giggled and colored and played with Barbie. The little girl inside the empty vessel surfaced in abrupt bursts of energy. She was brilliant.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-6246458963079136516?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cancer.<br /><br />Finally, they said it. Strangely, it was a relief. There were no more ambiguous references. No pregnant pauses. Just the word.<br /><br />Cancer.<br /><br />We expected to hear the word, though it never before entered conversations with the physicians. Today the word became part of the dialogue.<br /><br />Our daughter has cancer.<br /><br />Technically, she is diagnosed with low grade glioma in the form of leptomeningeal astrocytoma.Her prognosis is good. Dr. Finlay likened her condition to a chronic illness, abstractly analogous to asthma. In her present state, she is not a patient with terminal illness. Her doctors believe her tumor is treatable with a manageable regimen of chemotherapy. Radiation is happily not part of the plan, and the chemo cocktail they recommend will not cause her to lose her hair. The pathology of the cells biopsied showed very slow growth. Dr. Finlay commented that these cells appeared to be dividing &ldquo;in spite of themselves.&rdquo;  That means that we have ample time to wage war against the disease.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />Jordan&rsquo;s case is extremely rare. Dr. Finlay, who has been treating cancer patients for more than 20 years, has only seen three such cases in his career, and Jordan is #3. Her tumor is diffuse, meaning that it is not focalized in any region of the brain. There is no &ldquo;lump&rdquo;. Instead, her brain is covered in a mucus-like coating. In Jordan&rsquo;s case, this coating is comprised of cancerous cells that are under-achievers &ndash; their sluggish reproductive habits explain why she has looked and felt so healthy for nearly two years since the onset of her first symptoms. An advanced chemotherapy regimen aims to reverse that trend and bring the cancer under control.<br /><br />I like Dr. Finlay. Before you start sending me emails advising me not to be persuaded by the effect of personality, make no mistake, I will get second opinions. In fact, Dr. Finlay supports this decision. He offered full cooperation and advised me to do more than just send clinical test results and scan data. He wants to furnish tissue specimens from the biopsy to the neuropathologists of our choosing. But that&rsquo;s not what I like about Dr. Finlay. It&rsquo;s not his quiet confidence, either. Or his pedigree, which reads like something out of a Michael Crichton novel. I like Dr. Finlay because he is a cancer survivor. He knows the disease well because he fought it and won. His point of view on how to treat the disease while also ensuring a high quality of life for Jordan gave Jeanette and I some much needed optimism.<br /><br />Now for the bad news. Our little girl is still out to lunch. She goes through periods where her eyes are empty and she is less responsive. An EEG was ordered this afternoon - a test to check her brain wave patterns. We suspect she may be having absent seizures. If so, this might explain why she&rsquo;s recently had some trouble remembering things. Her brain is sleeping on the job. This will sound funny, but I was relieved by the cancer diagnosis and &ldquo;freaked out&rdquo; by her mental state. It&rsquo;s hard to witness the lapses in her spirit. Those who know Jordan know that she is a salsa spiced hot with flavor. She&rsquo;s usually bigger than life, excessively verbal and often outrageously expressive. Today, her main vocabulary word was &ldquo;yah.&rdquo; Every question was answered with &ldquo;yah.&rdquo; She watched the television with an expressionless face, only the hint of a smile. Her large eyes were fixed and trance like. There is hope that this symptom, too, is reversible. If she is, in fact, experiencing absent seizures, we are told there is medication to counteract and control the condition. Her neurosurgeons believe that these symptoms could be a side-effect of surgery that will pass with time. As one of the neurosurgeons reminded us, &ldquo;this was a surgery that, if performed on an adult, would be far more debilitating.&rdquo;<br /><br />She could come home tomorrow. I am apprehensive about this. She has poor balance and can barely stand on her own for very long. I&rsquo;d prefer she stay at the hospital another day for further observation. At the least, I&rsquo;d like her to spend some time with a physical therapist and a neurologist. She, however, is eager to return to her cats and her brother &ndash; in that order. We haven&rsquo;t talked to her about her diagnosis. We took a walk in the garden tonight to do just that, but she was getting cold and she just wasn&rsquo;t present mentally. We looked at her with her flaxen locks of hair extra curly from the gelatin used as a conductor for the EEG. She was an impressionist painting, full of light and beauty made pink by the dusk. Something about her was distant and soft. We decided to wait until she was more alert to have the discussion. I know she will handle it well. This is something she can fight, and Jordan has never shied away from a fight.<br /><br />When I was in business school, they administered a number of psychological tests to all new students. The object was to determine what kind of manager you were. One of those tests was called the &ldquo;locus of control.&rdquo; I was asked to answer several questions on a standardized questionnaire. Based on my responses, I was scored on a scale from 1 to 7, where 1 indicated that I had an entirely &ldquo;internal&rdquo; locus of control and 7 indicated that I had an entirely &ldquo;external&rdquo; locus of control. The average manager should have a score of about 4. My professor told me that I was the only student he could remember who scored a perfect 1. He advised me to rethink my &ldquo;life paradigm&rdquo;. Some things in life just happen, he said, and there&rsquo;s absolutely nothing you can do about them. Dr. Finlay believes this is Jordan&rsquo;s case. Her cancer is not a result of bad genes or environmental influence. It&rsquo;s just bad luck. She can, however, control how she manages this luck. Her cancer is treatable and she is capable of fighting it and living a productive and healthy life. That is what she will do. And one day, when she is complaining about the grey in her hair, and lamenting the fact that some children call her grandma, she will tell others how life sometimes deals a bad hand. She will tell them that the cards don&rsquo;t always determine your fate. Sometimes, they just alter your strategy.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-2390174511655720086?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She&rsquo;s had a very good morning. She slept well. She woke up smiling. She had no trouble standing on her own. She asked to go play. She ate a full breakfast and asked me to bring her tea this afternoon. We laughed as we pinched mommy and we joked about how clumsy I am. The neurosurgeons paid a visit early in the morning, and we were very glad to see Dr. McComb back on rounds. Something about his presence puts us at ease. She&rsquo;s still in PICU, but only because they cannot find a bed for her elsewhere in the hospital. They want to move her today. All of the tubes are gone, except for a dangling IV that they connect only when they need to administer medications. <a name="more"></a><br /><br />We&rsquo;ve been told that Dr. Finlay, the lead oncologist, will stop by to meet with us once she&rsquo;s moved out of the PICU. We&rsquo;re hoping that the pathology report has arrived so that we know more about what we&rsquo;re dealing with. The delivery of that report is the biggest point of contradiction. Some assert that it will definitely arrive today, others claim it takes far more time. We&rsquo;re not sure what to expect.<br /><br />In preparation for the pathology report, I started making contact with other pediatric oncologists across the country. I have a disc with Jordan&rsquo;s MRI scans on it, and I have requested a hard copy of the pathology report. These I plan to overnight to any expert who will review the case. It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t trust Dr. Finlay, because he&rsquo;s come with very high praise. I want to ensure we&rsquo;ve evaluated all of the treatment options before we proceed. Many of you have contacted me with connections to various doctors. Thank you for all of your suggestions. I have sent replies to some of you. I am most interested in finding inroads to UCLA because their pediatric oncology unit is very highly regarded. Other hospitals of interest: Children&rsquo;s National Medical Center, Children&rsquo;s Hospital Boston, Children&rsquo;s Hospital Philadelphia, City of Hope, Johns Hopkins Hospital. If you have any connections at any of these hospitals, please send me an email with directions on how I can connect.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-9141001083597574388?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jordan checked out of pediatric ICU this evening around 6:00pm. She&rsquo;s back in the oncology unit on the 4th floor of Children&rsquo;s Hospital. She is very happy to be back near a television that has more than one kids channel. When I left, she was engaged in a Sponge Bob Square Pants marathon. Her health was much improved. Other than a little nausea, she was far more lively. It was a good day for the whole family to catch its breath and recuperate.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />First, the facts. We had only a brief meeting with the oncologist. Most of the biopsy results are in, but Dr. Finlay is waiting on one last stain. The preliminary diagnosis is low-grade glioma. Glioma is a disease in which benign or malignant cells form in the tissues of the brain. Dr. Finaly did not discuss whether or not Jordan&rsquo;s glioma is malignant. That will be further addressed tomorrow. He did, however, remark that (a) radiation therapy was unlikely, (b) her case presents as more of a chronic condition, rather than a life-ending dilemma, and &copy; we caught it early and have a good jump on the disease. Tomorrow afternoon we will have an in-depth meeting with Dr. Finlay and his team to discuss their recommended plan of treatment.<br /><br />On the human side of the equation, Jordan was stronger today. Her will and personality resurfaced. Though she is pale, with soft circles forming under her eyes, her smile is radiant and effusive. She snuggled with me this evening after we settled into her new room. I sang standards to her. She sang improvisational lyrics to herself. Together, we bore  a commanding likeness to Ella and Sinatra, only tone deaf.<br /><br />The story in the story is the preciousness of community. So many of you have reached out to us and touched us in ways you may never imagine. 10 years ago, Jeanette and I moved into Olive Tree condominiums. We stayed for one reason: we liked our neighbors. Today, I LOVE my neighbors. They have been so supportive. There were six messages on my voicemail from concerned neighbors yesterday. All of them offering to watch Lucas while I spent time at the hospital. These beautiful people keep an eye on us and offer their time and their hearts to help us. We are much appreciative, and so very glad that we live in a loving community of friends.<br /><br />Others have come to the rescue in heroic ways. Minutes after I posted my earlier entry about second opinions, I received a deluge of emails. My long-time friend, Brette Simon, got to work quickly and connected me with the chief of pediatric oncology at UCLA after another long-time friend, Cheryl Spurlock, helped me navigate the UCLA medical infrastructure to identify who to contact. Shortly thereafter, I received an email from the doctor and the process has started. This all happened in the space of an hour after my post.<br /><br />People I&rsquo;ve never met before are sending me emails and posting comments to this blog. They have offered warm wishes, assistance and advice from the trenches. We have discovered an online community of families dealing with pediatric brain tumors, and have been invited into their circle of support. Parents of children with other serious illnesses have shared their stories and offered words of encouragement. I have never felt so loved or so connected to the fabric of community.<br /><br />Thank you to everyone. I share all of your comments with Jeanette, and often Jordan, too. Yesterday was a bad day - one of many to come. We survived it. I&rsquo;ve had my tantrum. I&rsquo;m certain that I will have many more. And I&rsquo;m sure Jeanette will have hers in the days that follow. It helps to share our experience with you. Your concern and your good faith make a big difference.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-2328773791788992682?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you were hoping to read a positive entry from me today, you should click on to another URL. I&rsquo;m dour and angry, resentful and dramatic. I usually try to dig deep down and find a bright side to share with friends and family, to keep everyone thinking good thoughts. But today was a bad day. My little girl is suffering and I&rsquo;m tired of trying to help others feel better about our situation. I want Jordan to feel better. I want my beautiful, charming, brilliant little girl to jump off of that hospital bed and come running back home. Sorry, folks, this journal entry is not part of Larry&rsquo;s optimistic library.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />Last night, before I left the hospital, Jeanette and I  began noticing a change in Jordan&rsquo;s behavior. She slurred more words together than usual. She kept squinting her right eye, like she did before she got the shunt last year. Sometimes she&rsquo;d get lethargic and stare at a fixed point. Occasionally, she&rsquo;d ramble on incoherently expressing random ideas. And she started shifting around in her bed, as though she couldn&rsquo;t get comfortable. Sometimes the movement seemed a little involuntary. Of course, when we asked her how she felt she would always reply, &ldquo;fine.&rdquo; We get the sense that if she wasn&rsquo;t feeling well, she wouldn&rsquo;t tell us anyway. Telling us might make the doctors want to work on her more, and she wants to get back home.<br /><br />When we noticed the change, we told the PICU staff. The problem is that Jordan looks good, on the surface. She still smiles, laughs and carries on a conversation. When doctors see that, they find it hard to believe things are getting worse, especially when she seems far better off than most of the other patients in the PICU. I&rsquo;m not saying they ignored us, but I do think they decided to pause to see if it was just a temporary issue - a side effect of surgery or medication.<br /><br />This morning, Jordan seemed a little better. She was talkative, but the slurring was still there. Every time she got up to use the restroom she got very dizzy and needed to lie down to recover. She also got a little nauseous. We continued to watch. A neurosurgeon came by to examine her in the morning. When he came by she was alert. But by the afternoon she was reporting a headache. I&rsquo;d had it. My baby&rsquo;s condition seemed to be obviously deteriorating and all the team was doing was giving her Tylenol. I went on the attack. I called her regular neurosurgeon&rsquo;s office and demanded that he look into her case. Instead, I got a call back from the neurosurgeon on call. He had the bedside manner of Donald Rumsfeld. I don&rsquo;t care how gifted you are, if you can&rsquo;t talk to a parent in a compassionate way, get out of the pediatric business. I found this doctor to be an arrogant, condescending, defensive beast who was far more interested in winning an argument with me than showing any genuine concern for my daughter. After I insisted, a CT scan was orderd to ensure that her shunt was not malfunctioning. The scan looked normal, but Jordan was anything but.<br /><br />Before the symptoms overwhelmed her, we played a game of Candyland and joked around for awhile. Things seemed alright. Then she needed to use the restroom. Again, she got very dizzy, unable to stand on her own. When she got back in bed she began twisting herself into awkward body positions. We had to help her get her bearings straight. She started whimpering sad little sounds. We asked her where she was hurting, but she refused to answer us - just more groans. Finally, she pointed at her tummy. When I looked in her eyes I could tell she was fighting something. She was concentrating and she was uncomfortable. She vacilated between wanting mommy and daddy to hold her hand and pushing us away. After several minutes, she rolled over and drifted off to sleep. Her marvelously expressive eyes were glazed. Her eyebrows were furrowed. She was still my beautiful girl, but the glow that she normally wore with such grace was faded.<br /><br />I snapped. I became useless. I had to leave, feeling guilty for leaving my remarkably strong wife to stay by Jordan&rsquo;s side.<br /><br />Everyone tells me to think positive thoughts and to pray. It&rsquo;s getting harder and harder to do that. I understand the premise, but I&rsquo;m not feeling very positive today. In fact, I&rsquo;m mad at the world. I&rsquo;ve had it with positive thinking and force of will. In that hospital room lies a wonderful light - a gift to the world. All her life she has touched others and brought joy and happiness to people &ndash; and now she&rsquo;s suffering. And the worst part is that I know  she&rsquo;s going to do more suffering. No matter how much positive thinking I do, I can&rsquo;t ignore the fact that the inevitable treatment she will receive is going to debilitate her and dim the lights even more. I just didn&rsquo;t let myself imagine that in addition to the poison she&rsquo;s about to consume in order to save her life, she might also suffer from further cognitive deterioration. I don&rsquo;t want to lose my little girl - in mind or in physical life.<br /><br />I know she&rsquo;ll have good and bad days. Today was a bad one. I love both of my children equally, but I love them in different ways. The love Jordan and I have shared has always been flirtatious and whimsical. We dote on one another. She trusts me to make her smile and protect her from bad things. Today, it was a challenge to do the former, and there was nothing I could do to help her on the latter. I wish I could take it all away and bring it on myself. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m one of many fathers who would trade places with his child in a heartbeat. But I can&rsquo;t. And there&rsquo;s nothing anyone can say or do to make me feel any better about that. I know many of you will try to say something that will keep me focused on positive stuff - and maybe tomorrow I will come back to that point of view - but tonight I am not buying any of it. I am screaming at the skies and letting the Irish in me burst onto the surface. For now, all of of my wars are merry, and all of my love is sad.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-7774034621732646863?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&hellip;(i who have died am alive again today, and this is the sun&rsquo;s birthday&hellip; - ee cummings, XAIPE, 65<br /><br />It was a good day. Certainly better than yesterday. And people who know tell me to take one day at a time. In chronological order: (1) my youth soccer team won its match 7-4, putting my boys 3-0 for the season; (2) my USC Trojans beat the Bears 23-17, putting them 5-0 for the season; and, (3) Jordan was alert for part of the day, smiling and nearly her same old self.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />She&rsquo;s still in PICU. Her vital signs are good. She slept most of the day, but when she wakes she is responsive to all tests and has very good cognitive function. She says she is not in any pain.<br /><br />When I arrived in the early afternoon she was eating a big ice cream cone from McDonald&rsquo;s. &ldquo;It soooo good,&rdquo; she exclaimed. She hugged me big and smiled gleefully when I gave her a gift from the boys on the soccer team - a beautiful plush puppy named &lsquo;Scraps&rsquo;. She nuzzled him and tucked him close to her side.<br /><br />We expect her to transfer to a bed in the oncology unit tomorrow. One of the oncology doctors met with us today to tell us that the pathology was not complete, but they expect results on Monday. Dr. Mason stopped by to visit (wearing a Cal t-shirt &ndash; sorry, Doc). He is the physician who leads the Infectious Diseases group at CHLA and he is also the man who has been managing her case up to now. As expected, her cultures aren&rsquo;t showing any signs of a bacterial or viral infection.<br /><br />While Jordan took a long nap, Jeanette and I slipped away for a nice lunch. We talked about other things, for a change. Jeanette is handling everything so well. I am proud of her. She gives so much to Jordan and gets so little thanks from her charge. I confess that Jordan dotes on me nearly as much as I dote on her. The negative side effect is that Mom often gets no credit for &ldquo;being there.&rdquo; Make no mistake, though. Jordan relies heavily upon her mother. She is as stable and well-adjusted as she is because her mother is always there for her. When the going gets tough, Jordan wants Mommy by her side.<br /><br />The writer in me always looks for a genre. Jordan&rsquo;s story is part of the heart-warming survival story. Every survival story has a loving mentor character. This chapter of Jordan&rsquo;s story is no different. Her PICU nurse Liz is playing that role of Angel. Liz was so wonderfully compassionate and patient with us last night when Jordan arrived at PICU. Her eyes were full of understanding and empathy. She took extra time to ask us if we had any questions. When she spoke, it was with the certain familiarity and comfort of a close family member. Luckily for Jordan, Liz was at her side again today. It put all of us at ease. If you&rsquo;re ever looking for a real-live angel, visit your local Children&rsquo;s Hospital and spend time with some of the nurses. They may not all be like Liz, but you are certain to find extraordinary souls attending the bedsides of needing children.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-356049403419275308?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Well-Manicured Girl in Pediatric ICU</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jordan&rsquo;s surgery went well. She was in the O.R. for nearly four hours. She will spend the next 24 hours in the pediatric ICU for observation. She&rsquo;s sleeping heavily and not having any major pain. Everyone expects her to recover from the surgery quickly and without complications. The rest of the news is not so good. The neurosurgeon&rsquo;s opinion is that we are dealing with a diffuse, inoperable brain tumor. It is inoperable for two reasons: (1) it is not focalized in any one specific area, and (2) some of the tumorous lesions are in areas that are out of reach for the surgical team, and dangerous to toy with. The oncology team will ultimately determine whether or not Jordan&rsquo;s condition is cancer. They will do this when the results of the biopsy are returned next week. But the neurosurgeon is no stranger to tumors and brain diseases, and he was candid about what he saw. It&rsquo;s too early to know what the treatment plan will be, but we should expect that the oncology team will want to proceed with chemotherapy or some other form of non-surgical treatment  soon. There is still every reason to believe we caught the disease in an early stage, and everyone has been optimistic about Jordan&rsquo;s strength and will to fight.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />The family is doing its best to cope with the news. I talked with Lucas tonight. He took it hard. I was glad that he finally allowed himself to get emotional. He&rsquo;s afraid, but he responded well when I reminded him that Lance Armstrong and Andres Galarraga both survived cancer and went on to make great accomplishments. His class made Jordan a &ldquo;Get Well&rdquo; card and he is eager to give it to her. We will arrange a visit tomorrow. Both children are eager to see each other.<br /><br />Jeanette and I do not  fear that Jordan will lose the war with cancer. We know that she can fight this disease. We trust in her physicians. We both believe that this &ldquo;life experience&rdquo;  will make Jordan a stronger person in the long run. Some people believe that life deals life-threatening circumstances only to those souls capable of challenging them. We think Jordan is made of the fighting/conquering metal. But we are dreading the battles ahead and the toll they will take on her.<br /><br />We all must think good thoughts and surround her with optimism. She is so remarkable. Today, as they were wheeling her into surgery, she started to cry. She said she was scared. She&rsquo;s never said this before. She&rsquo;s always gone into surgery or out-patient procedures with the will of an ox and the spirit of a clown. But today she was scared and she wasn&rsquo;t afraid to tell us she was scared. If that were the end of the story, it would be rather sad. But that&rsquo;s not Jordan. Once we arrived at the pre-operative waiting area she asked to use the restroom. Jeanette went with her. Jordan sobbed all the way there, but once inside Jordan asked for a wet towel to wash her face. She wiped off her tears, used the restroom, and changed her attitude. When she came back to the gurney she was smiling more, laughing at a cartoon on the television, and prepared to go into surgery. It was a remarkable transformation. I&rsquo;m sure she will repeat it many times, especially with all the love and support she is receiving from her friends and family.<br /><br />All of us are grieving the loss of Jordan&rsquo;s health. There&rsquo;s a lot of crying and people with puffy eyes. We believe this is part of the healing process. We need to let these feelings out so that we can have the strength to support Jordan. While this is a normal and natural reaction to bad news, it&rsquo;s important to remember that we&rsquo;re only grieving the loss of her health &ndash; not the loss of our daughter. She&rsquo;s still here and she needs our encouragement, love and enthusiasm. Please join us in wishing her good health and a long life.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-4206777809507031385?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nearly a year ago today, the greatest team in baseball __[yes, I&rsquo;m biased and prone to sweeping statements]__ made the playoffs but failed to advance to the big game. October 8, 2004: two games down, the Angels in Boston struggling to stay in the division series, facing the surging Red Sox, a formidable foe, aggressive, crafty and determined to leave a mark.<br /><br />I sit in a hospital waiting room. Jordan has been in surgery for four hours. A family of five dines on McDonald&rsquo;s to my right. The scent of chicken mcnuggets unsettles my already sour stomach. Every five minutes, I get up to spy the surgical monitor at the nurses station. Jordan&rsquo;s name is highlighted in a solid green box, indicating that she&rsquo;s still in the OR.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />On the television in the waiting room, the playoff game ensues. It&rsquo;s the bottom of the tenth. Vladimir Guerrero tied the game in the seventh with a crushing grand slam. Now, the Sox have a runner on base and David Ortiz up to bat. Angels closer Francisco Rodgriguez did his best, but manager Mike Scioscia makes a bold move and brings in veteran starter Jarrod Washburn, who is coincidentally my favorite Angel pitcher. His job: shut down the Sox rally. He throws only one pitch &ndash; one hanging curve &ndash; and Papi knocks it out of the park for a walk-off home run that sends the Sox to the ALCS and eventually a World Series triumph. I am crushed. <br /><br />A few minutes later, the green box changes to an orange box. Jordan is no longer in the OR. The neurosurgeon greets us in the lobby. The surgergy went well. But the diagnosis would change our lives. For the first time, we hear the words &ldquo;tumor&rdquo; and &ldquo;cancer&rdquo;. Jeanette and I stand in the lobby dumbfounded. My parents look on, struggling for words of comfort. The journey gained full speed.<br /><br />It&rsquo;s now October 2005. The Angels are back in the playoffs. Our family cheers as the team bests the Yankees. Then we cheer as the Halos win the first game against the White Sox. There is a familiar feeling about. It&rsquo;s the start of autumn. The air is crisp and post-season baseball and college football govern the television schedule.<br /><br />Jordan battles on. Her counts are stable. She bounces back after each dose of chemo. The girl is a gamer. Still, I am quelled by a superstitious nature. I take nothing for granted. The Angels still have difficult games to play, and Jordan has 13 months of chemo to endure. Two Angels starting pitchers are injured, while Jordan is losing her hair and and tires easily. Still, I hope. I root for the underdog and place my faith in the players with character.<br /><br />Jordan cozied up beside me in the eigth inning tonight. Scott Shields threw a wicked off-speed pitch that struck out the White Sox&rsquo;s Scott Podsednik. I shout out loud. Jordan asks me why I&rsquo;m so happy. I tell her it&rsquo;s because it was a beautiful pitch and the Angels are winning. She grasps me round the waist and intones &ldquo;Go, Angels!&rdquo; Tomorrow, Jarrod Washburn will face off against White Sox ace, Mark Buehrle. I&rsquo;ll be saying a prayer for Washburn. I met him once. He was a midwesterner through and through - confident, unassuming, quiet. He&rsquo;s a guy you want to win. When he throws the first pitch tomorrow night, I&rsquo;ll not be thinking of that hanging curve that ended the dream in 2004. I&rsquo;ll be thinking about a champion. And I&rsquo;ll be &ldquo;hanging&rdquo; with a girl who knows how to stay in the game. Deja vu.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-5284988700127074611?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The roast is cooked to perfection. Slightly pink in the center, moist but not raw. The fried potatoes steam over the plate, a faint hint of bacon wafting in the air. My arteries harden as I lean in to eat, knife and fork in hand.<br /><br />&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s say grace.&rdquo;<br /><br />Jordan&rsquo;s brow is peaked with rapt intensity, pertinence spilling onto the table from her ravenous eyes. I lower my utensils reluctantly; the habit of praying long lost. Luc is into his second bite. Jeanette glares at him as she bows her head. He chews inchoately. Jordan continues.<br /><br />&ldquo;God, thank you for Max &hellip; who died.&rdquo; Her brow knits as she closes her eyes. &ldquo;And tell him sorry that Charlie stepped on him when he was sick. Amen.&rdquo;<br /><br />We all watch as she deadpan awakens and pleasantly digs into her food. Lucas caps the moment with a smirk and a fourth grade tone, a chunk of roast hamstered in his cheek.<br /><br />&ldquo;Ohhhhhh kaaayyyyyy.&rdquo;<br /><br />Another glare from Jeanette. Sunday dinner begins.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />Max was our first family cat. He joined us when Jordan was barely a year old. A few months after we adopted him, we decided two cats were better than one and adopted Charlie, a frisky kitten who still ambles about our flat. Max was an older cat, and less than a year after settling in the Vincent household he grew ill and died of pancreatic cancer. In Max&rsquo;s final weeks, young Charlie tried in vain to play. Charlie innocently pounced on Max while he lay huddled in a heap of clothes in our closet. We&rsquo;d have to distract the precocious kitten to let the dying cat lie still. Jordan was too small to remember any of this, but she knows the story and she talks about it often, sometimes in the strangest places and at the oddest times.<br /><br />We boarded the elevator in our building a few months ago. It stopped on the fourth floor to gather another passenger. We didn&rsquo;t know him. He walked in reading a paper, barely acknowledging us. Then Jordan greeted him. When he answered her, she blurted out, &ldquo;Max died. He had cancer.&rdquo;<br /><br />The man stared blankly, not knowing what to say. Jeanette smiled and told him it was our cat. The man offered his condolensces, suddenly engaged. Jordan smiled and retold the story of Charlie stepping on Max. The man shuffled uncomfortably. I think I said something witty to lighten the mood, eager for the elevator ride to end. Jordan just smiled.<br /><br />Hers is an understandable preoccupation with cancer and with death, but it&rsquo;s seldom morbid. The temerity of her recollections are nearly always amiable. The story is unnerving to the recipient, even when they are unaware that Jordan is fighting cancer. It is jarring to hear a child speak so candidly about a dead cat. It&rsquo;s even more disconcerting to have it start an elevator conversation or surface in a dinner prayer. Yet Jordan likes to talk about it. And when she does, she is often wistful, like she&rsquo;s proud of Max and happy to share his memory with new friends.<br /><br />My friend Jim Sheehy, one of the most insightful men I&rsquo;ve ever met, once advised me against the &ldquo;politics of illness&rdquo;. Jordan was hospitalized at the time and Jim sent me an email to offer his support. I mentioned that I felt fatigued because I had to comfort so many people who reacted so severely to Jordan&rsquo;s condition. When they heard that she was diagnosed with cancer, some of them teared up and reacted emotionally. I always felt the need to comfort them &ndash; to assure them that she would be okay. I found myself dismissing my own fears to help our friends cope with the diagnosis. This was the phenomenon Jim recognized and counseled against. He argued that I needed to let my own emotions run their course.<br /><br />I am reminded of his advice as I watch Jordan process her own condition. True, she is sometimes sad, but when she is it is rarely out of fear for her future. She laments the process. She whines about being tired. She is frustrated when her brain doesn&rsquo;t respond at the pace she is accustomed. And sometimes, she is just sad for no specific reason. But she is never sad for the way others feel about her. And she is never sad about people (or animals) who suffer from cancer. She is fascinated by their journey. It is a bond, and though it may make others uncomfortable, she talks about it willingly. The discomfort is theirs to worry about.<br /><br />This paragraph may incriminate me for neglecting Jim&rsquo;s advice. It is intended as comfort for those who worry about my daughter. Jordan is deep into an unplanned life experience. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine a cheery angle to the subject of cancer or pediatric brain tumors. There are moments when experiencing the disease is agonizing and relentless. But there are also moments of brilliant revelation &ndash; shards of insight when the preciousness of childhood and family and storytelling with strangers sustain your sense of hope. When we follow a child&rsquo;s example, and supress the burden of adult supposition, we entertain the possibility of a life well-lived. When we learn to smile and speak well of dead cats, there&rsquo;s less to fear.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-5173773235595532150?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She has a dream. A monster chases her around the house, then begins to eat her. She says she stands still while the monster picks at her and it makes her sad. Until Daddy comes and scares the monster away.<br />Every time she tells me this dream I think to myself, &ldquo;no pressure!&rdquo;<br /><br />But for the dream, Jordan is happy. She doesn&rsquo;t dwell on many setbacks. She is less moody. And she is much more cooperative when she goes in for chemotherapy each week. Yesterday, she didn&rsquo;t even cry when they accessed her port. The truth is that while she is emotionally composed, she is physically fragile. Her body is showing the first signs of a compromised immune system. She is pale. She tires easily. And her blood counts are low.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />Last week, we experienced a slight scare. Her counts have been steadily declining. But last week a test showed that her hemoglobin dropped to &ldquo;crash&rdquo; level, meaning she would need a blood transfusion immediately. The test was run again and the second set of results were better, more inline with the weekly trend. She escaped this time without needing to tap our veins.<br /><br />Sunday, our family went shopping. It was a quick trip between football games. Jeanette and Lucas wanted to go to a store a block away while Jordan and I took our purchases to the car. On the walk to join the rest of the family Jordan began to drag. She was having trouble keeping up with me, so I slowed  my pace. I looked down and her face was ashen. She was smiling, but her lips were without color. I asked her how she was feeling and she told me she was a little tired. She said she wanted to take a nap. We wrapped up our excursion and relaxed at home for the rest of the day. She didn&rsquo;t nap, but she took to more sedentary activity. We made roast for dinner, hoping the extra iron might give her an energy boost.<br /><br />Last night we watched Monday night football together. I&rsquo;d ask her, &ldquo;now how many turns does the team have to go 10 yards?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Three!&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;No. Remember, four downs for ten yards.&rdquo;<br /><br />She snickered and held up four fingers. She had just emerged from the bath and her hair was wet. Ordinarily, I&rsquo;d ignore it. Trying to get Jordan to dry her hair is like leading a cat to a well. But there&rsquo;s little room for risk, so I rubbed it with a towel while she snuggled next to me and rambled on about playground activity.<br /><br />&ldquo;Jordan, Daddy wants to hear the game. You&rsquo;re chattering.&rdquo;<br /><br />She giggled, snuggled and fidgeted. Finally, at one point she looked up at me with those profound blue eyes and said, &ldquo;Daddy, I will always love you.&rdquo;<br /><br />Somebody scored a touchdown but I didn&rsquo;t see it. I just looked back at Jordan. Her restless hand was tapping the buttons on my shirt while her eyes wandered. I couldn&rsquo;t speak, couldn&rsquo;t think of anything to say. I didn&rsquo;t want to read into the heaviness of the remark or dismiss it for anything less than it was. And so I put my hand over hers and said, &ldquo;And I will always love you &hellip; madly.&rdquo; This made her smile and conjured a request for me to sing the Duke Ellington standard &ldquo;Love You Madly&rdquo;. A little while later she mosied off to bed.<br /><br />What Jordan doesn&rsquo;t know is that I, too, have had a dream. It unfolds very quickly. We are rushing her through a hospital lobby. It doesn&rsquo;t look like any place I&rsquo;ve seen before. We argue with the attendants at the nurse&rsquo;s station trying to get Jordan past them to an elevator. When we finally get into the elevator, there are doctors and nurses but I don&rsquo;t recognize any of them. I am holding Jordan&rsquo;s hand. She doesn&rsquo;t have any hair on her head and her scars are visible. She is beautiful, though her skin is pale and her body is frail. She is unconscious, lying still on the gurney. One of the nurses puts her hand over mine. She has a plain, expressionless face. In the background, the doctor speaks of &ldquo;the mass of disease&rdquo;. His words are clinical and daunting. Though every word he says is comprehensible, I don&rsquo;t understand what he is saying. I look at the pallid nurse holding my hand and she tells me to cry. I feel helpless and weak &hellip; and I cry.<br /><br />Every time I wake from this dream, I feel the same: defeated. In reality, the monster of Jordan&rsquo;s dream devours her in front of my very eyes. I hope to live up to her expectations &ndash; to chase the monster away &ndash; but it seems I only watch her health weaken, knowing that she is more vulnerable to illness than ever before, seeing her tire and slow in pace. I am challenged to reconcile the two dreams &ndash; to be a hero without breaking down and proving useless. It is a challenge best met by following Jordan&rsquo;s example: with steadfast courage and gentle tenacity.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-7608762062581269320?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I haven&rsquo;t written for awhile because I&rsquo;ve been on the road all week. It was hard being away. Jordan is doing well.

She only missed two days of school, and she&rsquo;s back to her familiar ways.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-386822108331158373?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Somehow I missed the call. I didn&rsquo;t notice until I set my phone on the desk and saw the alert flashing that I had a message. My day had been so long and tiresome I almost ignored it, but curiosity got the better of me and I dialed in to voicemail. It was Jordan.<br /><br />&ldquo;Dad, I snapped! All by myself. A real snap!&rdquo;<br /><br />Her voice oozed with pride. I sat back in my chair and listened to the message over and over, and I thought to myself, &ldquo;Hot damn!&rdquo;<a name="more"></a><br /><br />Henri-Frederic Amiel was a swiss philosopher and poet of the 19th century. His reputation is so obscure today that only philosophy majors tend to know his name. His one great work, <i>Journal Intime</i>, however, is filled with profound observations that often find their way into term papers and editorial columns. This one is no exception. I reference him now because he wrote something that perfectly heralds Jordan&rsquo;s small victory.<br /><br />&ldquo;What we call little things are merely the causes of great things; they are the beginning, the embryo, and it is the point of departure which, generally speaking, decides the whole future of an existence.&rdquo;<br /><br />For the last several days, Jordan has excelled at many &ldquo;little things&rdquo;. These victories are subtle to the casual observer but noticeable to her family &ndash; spelling words correctly, drawing recognizable pictures, snapping her fingers. We celebrate with measured praise because making too much fuss slows her down. She&rsquo;s a keen observer of what is and isn&rsquo;t said by those closest to her. An over-reaction only fortifies her fear that something isn&rsquo;t right. She doesn&rsquo;t want to be different. While she loves recognition, too much raises her guard. I know it sounds crazy, but we&rsquo;ve lived through this phase before.<br /><br />Still, when she isn&rsquo;t looking, Nettie and I grin knowingly. The snapping fingers of a child might seem a silly refuge, but until you&rsquo;ve heard the delight in her voice, you cannot understand how wonderful an accomplishment it is. She managed this feat only a few hours after visiting Childrens Hospital for her weekly labs and an exam with the oncologist. Tomorrow, she begins first grade at a new school with teachers and friends she&rsquo;s never met before. And in a few days, she&rsquo;ll return to Childrens for the next dose of chemotherapy. But to her, it&rsquo;s all a snap. And nothing makes me prouder.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-7543337379654876521?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The knot in my back throbbed. Even as I pressed it against the jet of water, the muscle was tight and unrelenting. I submerged my head to align the aching spot with the pulsing whirlpool blast. Underneath, I filtered out the world while the rhythm of the water beat against my eardrums. When my breath ran out, I floated toward the surface, opened my eyes and saw my son staring back at me, wearing swimmer&rsquo;s goggles, his hair mussed and wet-plastered to his head. He mouthed something to me, but I couldn&rsquo;t hear him.<br /><br />&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;<br /><br />The lips flapped again and his toothy grin widened. The wake of the water jet rippled against the middle of my back, right at the spot where the knot spasmed. I was in no hurry to move again. I told Lucas I couldn&rsquo;t hear him because of the water. Then he lifted his hand and poked his finger to his nose, laughing. I stretched my head from the surface just in time to hear him say, &ldquo;you have a booger.&rdquo;<a name="more"></a><br /><br />Our Labor Day was decidedly absent of labor. We packed up and drove to my parents house Saturday. Mom and I had tickets to an Angel game (perhaps the most stressful part of my weekend, as my beloved team spoiled a chance to pull ahead of Oakland).  Sunday, we lounged, ate and dipped in the hot tub.<br /><br />Jordan might well have been on a full-fledged vacation. But for the visible surgical scar while wearing her bathing suit, an unknowing observer would never have guessed that two weeks before she was hospitalized. She roamed my parents&rsquo; house with total command, relaxed and displaying maturity beyond her age. She smiled and occupied herself with coloring and creative games. She instigated the hot tub activity, jumping in nearly an hour before I dragged myself to the water.<br /><br />Despite my aching back, I relaxed, too. We all did. While my mom played hostess with her usual grace and charm, we vegged. It was therapeutic. My son and I bridged the gap that recently forged between us. We talked, laughed and acted sophomoric. Saturday afternoon I introduced him to the Will Ferrell classic, <i>Anchorman</i>, though I fast-forwarded through the parts I felt were unsuitable for a 9 year-old. For the rest of the weekend he and I quoted our favorite scenes.<br /><br />Lucas: Dad &hellip; Boy, that escalated quickly. I mean, that really got out of hand fast!<br />Me: It jumped up a notch!<br />Lucas: It did, didn&rsquo;t it?<br />Me: Yeah, I stabbed a man in the heart!<br />Lucas: I saw that. Brick killed a guy.<br /><br /><i>(you have to see the movie to understand the comedy)</i><br /><br />Sunday night, as we loaded into the car to go home, our family was hugging, laughing and talking again. Jordan carried herself with great poise. Somehow she&rsquo;s grown. She occupies much of her time coloring (in the lines) and practicing her letters. There is a sense of determination in her actions, but it is noble and stoic, not desperate. Her composure has unlocked us all. Now, if I could just get that knot out of my back&hellip;</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-8763949047203281206?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She is an inspiration. I&rsquo;ve scribbled a note to myself to remind me the next time I&rsquo;m whining about a client. After a grueling day of chemo, she still manages to laugh out loud and practice her sense of fashion. Knock wood, she hasn&rsquo;t been sick, though it is still early. When I got home, she cuddled with me and smiled with a grin as wide as the ocean. I cradled her, careful not to seem too concerned, and smiled back, humbled by my little girl. Cancer doesn&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s up against.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />Her first session went very well. Accessing the IV port was easy, but afterward she complained about the adhesive tape and dangling tubing. It&rsquo;s a long process. First, they push fluids to hydrate her. Then, the first drug, Carbo Platina, courses through. It is not allowed to circulate her body for long. Once the bag is empty, the next wave of fluids flush her system out. While the fluids are being pushed, she&rsquo;s allowed to wander the ward and occupy herself. But when it&rsquo;s time for Vincristine, she has to lie in bed monitored. She hates this. It&rsquo;s boring. For an hour, the drug drips into her system. When it&rsquo;s done, fluids are pushed for another two hours. The entire process takes about six hours, but she managed it bravely.<br /><br />Before she left the hospital, she called me to tell me she missed me. She sounded tired, but not sad. She reminded me to bring home the lollipop I promised her. It was the highlight of my day. I was so proud of her and so grateful to hear her voice coming through with such energy.<br /><br />She tired early tonight and summoned me to her room before turning in. She radiated in her pink pajamas. We giggled about the cats and gossiped for awhile. She just kept smiling as though it were any other day. After fretting for so long, I felt silly as I looked down upon her. She was teaching me a lesson. Though we still have a very long way to go, and we&rsquo;re certain to encounter setbacks, I&rsquo;ve placed my bet on the cute blonde girl resting in the bottom bunk of apartment number 1633.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-7547666144979938876?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[He crossed his arms and sulked, then threw back his head and exhaled a sigh brimming with contempt. I shot a look in the rearview mirror. Silence thickened the mood, adding drama to an already tense morning. Jordan ignored it and returned to her singing.

“Those blue eyes are going to get you in trouble. I fell in love with those eyes…”

She inflected her verse with a flavor of Billie Holiday, improvising the lyrics to <i>Them There Eyes</i>. She ignored her brother, choosing to scat while our car weaved along Interstate 5 en route to Children’s Hospital. A new chapter in the journey is about to unfold, but the leading characters are not who you think.<a name="more"></a>

My son is blessed with many gifts. He is smart, creative and thirsty for knowledge. He devours new subjects and immerses himself in sometimes obscure projects. But one of his greatest gifts is his perception. When not completely self-involved, he is keenly capable of sensing how people feel, and he is usually quite good at saying just the right thing. Two years ago, at my sister Kelly’s birthday party, friends and family took turns saying something memorable about the birthday girl. Most of the stories were witty anecdotes designed to rib. When it was Lucas’ turn, he smiled at his aunt and said, “What can I say about Kelly. Well … she’s beautiful. And I love her.” Every female in the room swooned and dabbed at their eyes.

So it has been unsettling to witness Lucas’ behavior these past few days. He seems to be out of touch with his gift. He is often rude, selfish and insensitive to the tension that lingers in our household. I dismiss most of the behavior because deep down, I know that he is hurting. I realize that he is attempting to be strong. He has bottled up his fear and his anxiety, and the pressure is smoldering out in an unwelcome form of defensive self-preservation.

We are all unlike ourselves these days. We bend and stretch to eccentric differences in personality far more than we normally would. Our family is healing. The wounds have scabbed, but the sensitivity remains. But Lucas’ behavior is disruptive to the healing proceess. It was at its worst today.

It was our first trip back to CHLA since Jordan was discharged last week. The oncology team would examine her and consult with Jeanette and I on the changes in the chemotherapy protocol. We dreaded the conversation, for we knew that it would force us to accept the realities of cancer treatment. She will probably get sick. She is likely to lose her hair. She may need blood transfusions when her body’s immune system is compromised by the destructive effectiveness of the new drugs. It started today – we had to face facts and prepare ourselves for a long fight.

Jordan was animated. To a casual observer, it would be easy to surmise that she was unaware of what lay ahead. But we knew the real story. She was too chatty. She was too wistful. Her attention drifted too often. She was nervous. She knew that being a cancer patient was about to take on a new meaning. It scared her and created restless energy she had to expel. For her, that meant singing.

Lucas was annoyed that he had to go to the hospital with us. He wanted to stay with a friend. Knowing that Jordan would start her chemotherapy the next day, a process that takes several hours, we reasoned that it was better to situate him elsewhere tomorrow and keep him with us today. He did not appreciate the logic. He whined and nagged all morning long. By the time we dragged him down to the car we were twenty minutes behind schedule and our nerves were frayed.

Looking back at him on the drive, anger welled inside me. Where was my bouyant, sensitive young man? How could he behave this way <i>today</i>?

Then, he surprised me again. He started chastising his sister. He barked at her to stop her singing. When she wouldn’t, he ordered me to turn the radio on. Not wishing to capitulate to a bossy child, nor to stop Jordan from singing, I refused. He groaned and sighed with a great sense of exasperation. I bit my tongue. Jordan continued her song. Her nervous energy needed to stay in motion, and truthfully, I enjoyed hearing her sing. But Lucas hated it.

“JORDAN! I DON’T WANT TO HEAR YOUR CONSTANT CHATTERING!”

I snapped.

“LUCAS, SHUT UP!”

My response escaped so quickly I had no time to consider how strongly it would come across. I never tell my children to shut up. I rarely yell at them. They are precious to me, and I’ve never wanted to groom them by way of intimidation. But I had never before been so angry with my son. My mind was racing with harsh logic I wished to crush him with. I held it back. My outburst proved effective. The car was silent. Lucas’ eyes were wet as he looked away, out the window toward the passing streets.

I pulled the car into the hospital driveway. Lucas started to exit the car with the girls, but I told him to stay. They headed in while we went to park. For a few minutes, we drove silently. I chose my words carefully, slowly articulating with measured emotion.

“Lucas, I would never let anyone talk to my children the way you just spoke to your sister. I am disappointed in you. On a day when she is very nervous you chose to bully her.”

He wailed from the backseat, tears streaming down his face. The outburst was sudden and full of hysterics. I continued on, working up steam.

“You are sending the distinct impression that you aren’t happy with this family. You show us your displeasure every chance you get. Perhaps you would prefer to live somewhere else - somewhere that won’t burden you so heavily. Even though I think you are really just as afraid as the rest of us, you’ve chosen not to talk about it, and I’ve respected that decision. But, I’ll be damned if I let you take it out on your sister. Do you have any idea how scared she is? How would you feel if you were in her shoes?”

He let out a gutteral cry and sobbed. I realized it was the first time he had cried in front of me since Jordan was hospitalized. I suspected that all of his pent up emotions were now pouring out. I knew my words were harsh. I wanted to hold him and coax him to talk, but this was a lesson he needed to learn, and I didn’t want to send mixed signals.

We sat in the car for a few minutes. Then we got out and headed toward the oncology ward. Lucas joined Jordan in the play room while Nettie and I met with the doctor. We faced the harsh reality of intravenous chemotherapy better than I expected. Perhaps it was because we knew what was coming. Dr. Jabron was patient and supportive. It was somehow comforting to hear a doctor speak so frankly - to talk of “the disease” and discuss the side-effects of treatment. When it was done, my mind was blank. Only the gravity of my interaction with Lucas remained.

Later that day, he revisited the subject. Jordan was napping, so Jeanette and I sat him down and talked. The silence that had plagued our house lifted. We were more open with Lucas than we had ever been. We told him what the doctors had told us: this would be a 15-month treatment that would be very hard on Jordan’s body. We told him how we felt about him: that we loved him very much, but were disappointed that he seemed so unhappy. We encouraged him to talk about how he felt - to ask questions, to address the awkward observations, and to cry. When the talk was done, I looked over at him, slouched on the sofa. His eyes were pink and he looked uncertain of what to do next. I grabbed him by the forearm and pulled him close. He clutched me round the waist and cried for several minutes while I gently stroked his wild platinum hair.

It was not a problem easily solved. I have no idea whether it is solved at all. It wasn’t about me being right and him being wrong, It was about keeping the family together. Lucas is at that age where autonomy grows in importance. But we need him now. At nine years old, I’m sure there will be many more tense discussions between us. But for this moment, we were reconnected. I wanted him to perceive again. I wanted him to be strong for Jordan. I learned that I needed to be stronger for him.

He apologized later that night … and hugged his sister before turning in for bed.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With each new day Jordan is getting stronger and more like her old self. Her sleep cycle hasn&rsquo;t returned to normal, yet. She generally crawls into our bed around 4am and takes a long nap at around 10am. She&rsquo;s a little less moody, and her wit is regaining its sharpness.<br /><br />Wednesday we meet with the oncology team to discuss the new chemotherapy protocol. Jordan will return on Thursday to get started. The side effects of the new medicine are more onerous than the last. We&rsquo;ll have to watch her closely for awhile. Thankfully, she has had no further seizures. She&rsquo;ll be seeing her neurologist soon.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-6032026018202725639?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>D.H. Lawrence advised that &ldquo;it is no good casting out devils. They belong to us. We must accept them and be at peace with them.&rdquo; Each of us harbors a demon. Jordan&rsquo;s is a cancer. It will not be ignored and for the moment, she cannot cast it out. So tonight, she weeps.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />We imagined tonight would be a happy occasion. She is home. It was the goal she rallied about all day. When the doctors granted her wish, she was beside herself with accomplishment. She fidgeted and fretted waiting for the final discharge papers. We expected tonight to be mellow and peaceful.<br /><br />Something about coming home struck a chord with our little girl. Within an hour of arrival she was acting strange, as though the high point of her day delivered disappointment. She thought coming home would cast out the demon. But when she arrived, the demon was there to greet her. She talked of being afraid, feeling pain, feeling tired. Neither Jeanette nor I tried to stop her. Where usually we would create distraction or offer counter-suggestion, tonight we held her and let her wail. Who wouldn&rsquo;t feel afraid? Wouldn&rsquo;t any of us be sore and uncomfortable two days after surgery? Everyone in our family is fatigued. One can only imagine how tired she must be. Perhaps, by letting her grieve, we allow her to make peace with the demon. Maybe, as painful as it is for us, as much as we wish her to bubble and beam, maybe it is better to let her wallow in depression for a night. Maybe by doing so, she skips along the boundary of her fears and learns to accept what most she doesn&rsquo;t understand.<br /><br />She is surrounded by love: her family, her friends, and her caregivers. When she is prepared to fight, there are armies at the ready. But no man or woman can lead an army fearlessly every day. Patton said, &ldquo;if we take the generally accepted definition of bravery as a quality which knows no fear, I have never seen a brave man.&rdquo; Jordan is brave. But bravery means doing what is necessary even when our fear counsels otherwise. And Jordan fights the fight, regardless of the way she feels inside.<br /><br />A week ago, when she was admitted to the hospital, she was disoriented and suffering from an electrical storm surging in her brain. The doctors needed a CT scan to determine whether or not she was hemorrhaging. A few years ago, I explained to her that a CT scan was a big donut that took her picture. I advised her to smile while it rotated and whirred. Last Saturday, in the midst of all her fears, threshing about and crying intensely, when we finally got Jordan to lie down for the scan, she smiled. There was no pleasure in it. The smile was forced. It was what she knew she had to do. And when the scan was done, she let herself cry again.<br /><br />Though it pains me to watch her unwind in self-pity, I am humbled by her courage. I am grateful to learn from her example. I have faith in her resolve. Tonight, she can cry as much as she wants. She can feel sorry for herself. It is her right. Tomorrow, she will join her family for breakfast. We will drink tea. The demon will join us. I have no doubt that Jordan will measure her enemy&rsquo;s weaknesses and lead us from the front.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-9138957539432651718?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She&rsquo;s bored and she wants to go home. Being awake is taking a toll. She doesn&rsquo;t enjoy the hospital. Every time I move around the room she asks me where I&rsquo;m going. Then she asks if she can come home with me. On the bright side, she&rsquo;s giggling again. She&rsquo;s back to recounting obscure comedic moments from her favorite films. Then her face sours and she laments being connected to wires and tubes. She is cross whenever she feels the port. It is not the device itself, but the tape holding it to her skin that she abhors. Though we are blessed by the return of her wit, it is accompanied by the return of sharp observations about her own condition. She told me flatly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be sick anymore.&rdquo;<a name="more"></a><br /><br />I arrived late this morning. Both girls were fast asleep. I left my things and grabbed a cup of coffee. When I returned, Jeanette was awake and off to the shower. Jordan was curled in a ball lengthwise across her bed. Her sleep cycle is discombobulated. She kept her mother awake from 2-4am rambling on with thoughts and anecdotes. As noon approached, the nurse suggested we wake her to get her back onto a normal schedule. I curled beside her, kissed her cheek and whispered that her breakfast was waiting for her. Her eyes fluttered open and then she sat straight up. She smiled and tackled a stack of pancakes. Between bites, she caught up with me and began lobbying to flee the hospital.<br /><br />She has trouble walking. With each baby step she wails a whimpered cry of trepidation. She&rsquo;s using the restroom again, and she&rsquo;s very happy to be back in her own undegarments. She resented the diapers, defiantly telling us she was not a baby. She was so insulted by them that she insisted we find pajama breeches to match her hospital gown. I told Nettie that the surest sign of our daughter&rsquo;s recovery was the resurfacing of her mad streak of independence and stubborn attention to fashion.<br /><br />In the afternoon, the hospital chaplain stopped by. I had phoned my parish earlier in the week, and they called Father John. He was a kind man who brought Jordan a fleece blanket and pillow patterned with lady bugs. She put them to immediate use. We talked with Father for awhile, me reconnecting with my tortured Catholic guilt. Whenever I realize how infrequently I practice my faith (and it truly is infrequent) I fear the clergy will ask me to turn in my reg card. But Father John was understanding and offered to sit with us just to talk, if we needed it.<br /><br />I asked Jordan if she wanted a blessing, and she said yes. Father asked her if there was anything specific for which she&rsquo;d like to pray. She asked him to pray for her grandfather (my dad, who died in 1998). Father was surprised that Jordan wanted to pray for the dead. He reminded her that her grandfather was still with her in heaven and told her that it was very good that she wished to send him her prayers. He told her that he was sure grandfather was praying for her, too. She ignored his observation and then she asked to pray for Max &ndash; her dead cat. Sensing a pattern, we held our breath as Father agreed to include Max in the blessing. He was about to start his prayer when Jordan added, &ldquo;and my friends. I want to pray for my friends.&rdquo; (Fortunately, they are all among the living.)<br /><br />Father started the blessing and said some very sweet words about all of the people Jordan wanted to pray for. Then he asked God to bless Jordan and help her feel better. I glanced over and saw that she was frowning. Her mouth was melting and her eyes were puffing up. I asked her what was wrong.<br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared,&rdquo; she whispered.<br /><br />Father paused for a moment. Jeanette and I held Jordan&rsquo;s hands and offered quick words of comfort while Father finished the blessing. Jordan snapped back and charmed the priest with stories about her cats. As we shook his hand and thanked him for visiting us, Jordan shifted her attention to the Disney Channel. There would be no further talk of dead cats and relatives, nor discussions about her illness.<br /><br />She doesn&rsquo;t know about the seizures, and we haven&rsquo;t quite figured out how to tell her, or if we even need to. She does remember the accident. She told her mother that the light post tripped her. Then she cursed it and gave it ample blame for putting her in the hospital. She still thinks her birthday is due to arrive, though we tell her it has passed. We plan to celebrate in good measure when she gets back home.<br /><br />The doctors are talking of her sending her home soon. She&rsquo;s making the transition from intravenous to oral medications. A game plan is in the works for her new chemotherapy protocol, and we have a team of specialists ready to examine and work with her in the days ahead. She is acutely aware of the fact that people are watching her and giving due scrutiny to all her actions. Every so often she will tell us, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m zero.&rdquo; At first, we psycho-analyzed this statement and assumed she was feeling low self-worth. In fact, she was referring to a sign on the bulletin board across her bed. There are six stick figure faces, with differing facial expressions. The zero is a happy, smiling face. The six is a very unhappy, painful face. Jordan reminds us whenever she can that she is happy. The better to convince her doctors and us that she is ready to go home.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-5627046883158403087?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jordan&rsquo;s surgery was a success. She handled it bravely, only complaining in pre-op that she was hungry. When I told her she couldn&rsquo;t eat anything until after the surgery, she replied, &ldquo;that stinks!&rdquo; When we returned to her side about an hour later, the first words out of her mouth were, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry.&rdquo; She devoured a purple popsicle and asked for pancakes. We took that as a good sign.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />She&rsquo;s been sleeping well, and today was by far her most verbal. The swelling on her tongue subsided, making it easier for her to form words. Despite being anesthetized, she strung sentences together with the same precocious attitude to which we&rsquo;ve grown accustomed. Yet, sometimes those sentences were the clearest indication of her illness. At random times she would bark an order to Lucas, even though he was twenty miles away. Or, she&rsquo;d ask questions such as, &ldquo;is that dog real?&rdquo; Of course, there wasn&rsquo;t a dog in the room. And then there are the ticks. She occasionally suckles her lips. Her hands are often in restless motion. Once, she rolled over and flicked her pillow defiantly with her finger, then rolled back onto her back.<br /><br />Before the surgery, we all were filled with nervous energy. Jeanette and I reminded each other that this procedure was minor. We rationalized that Jordan had triumphed over two neurosurgeries. Surely, this simple implanation of a catheder would be a piece of cake (and it was). Still, when we once again rolled our daughter down the hallway, our anxiety pulsed. It&rsquo;s dreamlike. We roll down a corridor we pass through every day. But then we round a corner near the elevator bank, and the orderly pushes a button. Double doors open to a hidden hallway, whiter than the others. It is bedecked with high-placed windows that allow bright light to filter in. The hidden corridor is more sterile, and everyone wears blue and green scrubs. When you enter this hallway, you realize the gravity of the circumstances. It&rsquo;s surgery.<br /><br />It went quickly. The surgeon earned our confidence â€“ she was a warm, upbeat woman with definitive answers to our questions without any trace of arrogance. She met with us after it was done and praised Jordan&rsquo;s spirit. The only complication was a slight seizure just after they finished sewing her up. Medication calmed her down. She&rsquo;s been stable all afternoon.<br /><br />We don&rsquo;t know how long Jordan will stay at CHLA. The plan for now is to keep her stable. The anti-seizure medication currently prescribed is a short-term solution. We&rsquo;ll have to transition to an oral medication she can take regularly to maintain balance. And then there&rsquo;s the matter of the chemotherapy. Her medical team will meet with us shortly to discuss our options. In the meantime, Jordan&rsquo;s comfortably situated on the east side of floor six.<br /><br />Lucas is beginning to process the circumstances. Like us, he is in shock. He and I broach the subject now and again, but we inevitably move on to something else. He hugs me, and tells me that he loves me often. I hug him back and we pat each others backs to lighten the mood. I worry about him as much as I worry about her. In some ways, I fear he is more fragile. You can knock Jordan down, but she&rsquo;ll always pull herself back up. It may not be pretty, but she&rsquo;s going to prevail. Lucas is the more adventurous. He&rsquo;ll try just about anything, and he brims with confidence. But his spirit is easily wounded, and it takes him longer to recover. He&rsquo;s putting on a great show of being brave. I hope he knows it&rsquo;s perfectly fine to be as scared to death as the rest of us. I hope he knows that we are resolved to take this journey with Jordan together. If there is one lesson I have learned through this experience, it is that we are not alone.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-2709019740985210149?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Her eyes were open when I walked through the door. She fixed her gaze on me with one brow arched, the way she so often does when sizing me up. I glanced at Nettie to make sure what I was seeing was real.<br /><br />&ldquo;She&rsquo;s awake &hellip; and she&rsquo;s talking,&rdquo; Jeanette advised.<br /><br />&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great! How ya doin&rsquo;, Jordan?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Gooood,&rdquo; she replied while turning her attention to another corner of the room.<br /><br />It was a better day today. Though heavily medicated and at only about 20% of her usual self, Jordan was alert, awake and communicative. It sometimes took her awhile to formulate a response to our ceaseless barrage of questions, but the spark of her will resurfaced. Jeanette asked her what channel she wanted on the television.  A pause. She thought Jordan didn&rsquo;t understand or hear the question, so she asked again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking!&rdquo; Jordan reprimanded. And thus we saw the most important of the vital signs &ndash; the love of the fight.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />We still have a long way to  go, and we&rsquo;re not exactly celebrating what we&rsquo;ve learned. From now on, when Jordan so much as twitches, every time we get a call from her school, and whenever she looks just a little too distant, Jeanette and I will  fear she&rsquo;s seizing.<br /><br />The halcyon days of oral chemotherapy are done. Jordan will begin a much more aggressive protocol, requiring weekly intravenous doses. She may lose her hair (but it will grow back). And tomorrow, she will have minor surgery to implant a &ldquo;port&rdquo;, a way for the doctors to draw blood and administer the chemotherapy without continuously tapping her veins with an IV.<br /><br />But she was talking again. It was sometimes hard to understand all that she said because her tongue is swollen from where she twice bit it during her seizures yesterday. But other times she was clearly articulate - downright annunciating syllables with precision. Her eyes were more attentive, though they still wandered off now and again, sometimes floating up to signal she had temporarily &ldquo;left the building.&rdquo;<br /><br />The family rested today. Yesterday was brutal, and we don&rsquo;t know what tomorrow will serve. Though the surgery is routine, it&rsquo;s still surgery. It has never been easy for us to kiss her on the forehead as they wheel her into the O.R. And the hardest part is yet to come â€“ the alchemy of balancing medications. The oncologists and neurologists must find the right mix of drugs to keep the seizures under control, while blasting the tumors with chemo. All the while, they must try and minimize damage to her liver. It&rsquo;s a strong liver &ndash; from good Irish stock &ndash; but it can only take so much.<br /><br />Thank you to all of our friends and family who have called and emailed us with words of encouragement and support. I realize my last posting had a tinge of Sylvia Plath. There are memories of yesterday I&rsquo;d love to erase from my brain forever, but I will probably never make them go away. Thankfully, I feel very fortunate to have people around me who let me venture into the dark spaces with one hand upon the light switch.<br /><br />There&rsquo;s an old quote about the Irish by G.K. Chesterson that fits our family very well, explaining Jordan&rsquo;s inspiring resolve and my self-indulgent broodings:<br /><br />For the great Gaels of Ireland,<br />Are the men that God made mad.<br />For all their wars are merry,<br />And all their songs are sad.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-5785717572900070452?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[You want to be wrong. You want everyone else to be right. For every negative thought that passes through your head, you want to believe that “thinking positive” will ward away what most you fear. Well-wishing friends instruct you to dispel skepticism, will against negativity, and imagine wellness. You try. You really try. But in the recesses of your mind, whispering just loud enough so that your rational stream of consciousness can hear, your inner voice gossips about what could really happen. And when fate agrees, and one of those pessimistic, back-biting ideas really does happen, the negative fringe incites rebellion. Every synapse in your brain attracts itself to the seemingly clairvoyant notion. Perception scrambles for a leader, and the logical point of view rescues sanity from the anarchy of positive thinking.<!--more-->

We were cold-cocked today. Jordan’s condition deteriorated. She’s having seizures now. Though we are told they are causing no damage, they are horrific to witness. Our little girl with the sun-kissed hair, the hair she modestly tells strangers costs some women a hundred dollars, convulses and jerks uncontrollably. There is nothing we can do but look on. And inside my head, my worst fears begin rallying support. “See,” they murmur, “I told you this would happen.” Then I feel bad for even thinking this, imagining that worrying about it in the past caused it today. And then I think I’m cracking up. I’m analyzing every thought while my daughter suffers. I keep kissing her and holding her hand and telling her I’m by her side, even though she shows no sign of hearing. Jeanette and I take turns breaking down. Then we sit. And wait. And hope.<a name="more"></a>

The day began on the battlefront: me versus the medical establishment. I went to bed angry the night before. I had no answers. No data. And the logic of the medical team seemed lacking. They dismissed Jordan’s fall on Saturday as coincidental â€“ having nothing to do with her condition. I asked them, “if you didn’t know this child had cancer, would you still be diagnosing as you are?” It got their attention, and my squeaky wheel summoned grease. All the big guns came by today, and before noon I started feeling a little better. Jordan was still unconscious, but she murmured once in awhile and she didn’t seem to be getting worse.

My emotions ran hot and cold. Late in the morning, I had really worked up a lather about the pace of Jordan’s care. I didn’t feel she was getting enough attention. They hadn’t scheduled her EEG or her MRI, and we still had no answers. I went down to the garden to make two calls. The first was to a friend in the medical community, who counseled me on what to ask. Armed with her insights, I felt better equipped to navigate the establishment. But I was still mad, and I knew confronting the doctors angry would not get me very far. So I made the second call: to my good friend Lorena. I blew up and she listened patiently. And then, I broke down. I just fell apart in front of dozens of people. Lorena let me go. Deep down, I knew I had to let all this out if I wanted to keep my head in the game as I confronted professionals who had spent a lot more time in school than me. When I settled down, I gathered my things and headed back to Jordan’s room. I was going to plead my case: Jordan had head trauma and the medical team was not doing enough to address the obvious issue. She hit her head. Yes, she had cancer, but why was that the only route the team would consider. As far as we knew, Jordan had never had a seizure.

But when the elevator door opened on the sixth floor, Jeanette was standing there. It felt scripted. Just as I was coming back, she was headed down to find me. The first words out of her mouth were “Jordan had a seizure.” Though she was trying to be very strong, I could tell she was in shock. I still hadn’t processed what she said, and my argument felt utterly useless. We went back to the room.

People were moving faster now. Or, at least it seemed that way. They wanted to administer anti-seizure medication, but I still wasn’t ready. We hadn’t seen a neurologist and they hadn’t conducted the EEG study. I did what I do best: argue. The poor resident who came to get our consent for the medication didn’t know what hit her. And I confess, I felt bad at the intensity of my litigation. How could they prescribe anti-seizure medication when they weren’t positive she was having seizures? How could the neurology team prescribe medication when they hadn’t even examined my daughter? To make matters worse, we were told that there would be no way to get the EEG today. That was the final straw for me. I locked in my heels and said “No.”

In retrospect, I feel guilty about this decision. Jordan was having seizures. Jeanette had seen it with her own eyes. My interference might be causing Jordan more pain and suffering. But I felt she was being ignored and I was terrified that we were medicating symptoms without having any real data or analysis. Fortunately, my intransigence paid off. Twenty minutes later, Jordan was wheeled to neurology and had her EEG. It showed no signs of seizures during the test, but one half of her brain was less active--a watermark that seizures may have occurred earlier. Jeanette and I agreed to allow the team to administer anti-seizure meds. But, we did this after a full consultation with the attending neurologist.

The seizures kept coming. I was seeing them now. And with each one, more doctors and nurses ran to her bedside â€“ a fact that made Jeanette and I tense. This was serious. A second CT scan was ordered immediately. Her medication was increased, and people were being very careful to tell us everything. Ironically, it was during this time that Jordan began mumbling incomprehensible statements. We hadn’t heard her speak since we admitted her 48 hours ago. She called for me. I leaned in. She tried to form words but I couldn’t understand. Then she rolled her eyes back and disappeared. A little later, she opened her eyes and looked right at me. I leaned in and said “Hi, gorgeous.” She smiled and then faded out again. Somewhere, in all this chaos, there was a reason to hope. She was in there. Now, we just have to figure out how to get her back.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I don&rsquo;t write, it is usually a sign that things are going well, or that I&rsquo;m traveling too much. Both circumstances explain the long gap between these entries. Quite frankly, I hoped my blogging days were behind me, or that I could start a new blog that covered more upbeat topics. But, here I am, back again, providing you with news on Jordan&rsquo;s condition. She is back in the hospital as a result of new symptoms related to her battle with cancer.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />Yesterday was her birthday. She is now seven years old. At about eight in the morning she bounced into our bedroom bubbling with excitement about turning older, eager to be pampered far more than she is on any other day. Her wide smile beamed as she jumped on our bed and asked to see her present. Seconds later, the paper was off and the brand new computer games were running on her computer. She sang happily while waiting for the content to load up.<br /><br />She wanted to go to Green Street for breakfast, so the three of us (Lucas is on a camping trip) showered and headed to our favorite breakfast spot. She ate well and positively gushed when the waitress delivered a sunday after her meal. &ldquo;I can have ice cream for breakfast!&rdquo; she lilted.<br /><br />From there we went shopping, she eager to use the Barnes &amp; Noble gift card her aunt and uncle gave her. We lounged in the bookstore for about an hour and Jordan bought a fashionable Princess diary to record her many thoughts. We took the slow route home, stopping in a few shops to browse. Jordan decided she needed sunglasses, so we headed across the street to check Gap Kids. I was two steps into the intersection when I heard her crying. I turned around to see her lying face down in the street. She had tripped and her knees were scraped. A small goose-egg was forming on her forehead. We rushed her across the street to a restaurant to get some ice. Within a few minutes she was plotting on how to take candy from the hostess desk and we figured she was feeling better. We headed home, iced the wound some more and put band-aids on  the other scratches. Her mood had changed. She was happy again. After watching some TV, she decided to take a nap.<br /><br />Two hours later, she woke disoriented. She barely made it to the bathroom when she got sick. That alone was sign to us that something wasn&rsquo;t right, but there was more. She was favoring one side of her body. Her left seemed limp, unresponsive, paralyzed. Her speech was slurred and she looked troubled. I hadn&rsquo;t seen her like this since the last surgery, and I wasn&rsquo;t prepared to see it today. I couldn&rsquo;t move. Normally, I know what to do right away, but today I was stuck. This couldn&rsquo;t be happening. Although only a minute or so, it seemed like I stood there with a dumb look on my face for an hour. Finally, I got on the phone with Children&rsquo;s Hospital and was told to bring her in immediately.<br /><br />The ride to the hospital was gut-wrenching. Jordan moved in and out of consciousness in the back seat. When she tried to speak, her words were indecipherable. How could this be happening? Only hours before, she was celebrating her birthday, charming sales clerks and imagining what to do with the rest of her day. Why this? Why now?<br /><br />Things got worse at the emergency room. She became conscious again and the realization of where she was set in. This triggered fear. She screamed and begged us to take her home. There was no way to console her. Then, just as we were beginning to talk with her, she would get disoriented again. She thrashed and writhed away from us, repeating slurred phrases that were just articulated enough for us to understand: &ldquo;Daddy, take me to the car.&rdquo;<br /><br />It took us nearly an hour to calm her enough to lie still for the CT scan. They had to strap her down to keep her from getting out. Seeing her held against her will, sobbing and looking so afraid crushed me. I tried to cheer her and congratulate her for doing such a good job, but I wept as I fixed on her agonized face. Her eyes were bloodshot and puffy from crying.<br /><br />On the way back to the ER holding room, Jordan&rsquo;s left side went limp again. Her speech fell apart and she became more agitated. The doctors and nurses were able to see it this time, and even though her CT scans showed no sign of concussion, shunt malfunction or internal bleeding, they knew something was very wrong. Unfortunately, because they had to consider the possibility of seizures, they refused to give Jordan a sedative. So for the next two hours, Jeanette, my mom and I tried to restrain her thrashing anger behind the closed doors of her ER patient room. She screamed. When her words were available to her, she pleaded with each of us. &ldquo;Take me home.&rdquo; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to the car.&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let them hurt me.&rdquo;<br /><br />I couldn&rsquo;t watch this anymore. I went to the nurses station and demanded to see the attending doctor. She was very kind. A team of doctors had been on the phone since Jordan&rsquo;s arrival, including her neurosurgeon and her oncologist. They all suspected that the decline in Jordan&rsquo;s health was due to new tumor growth. The accident in the morning was just a trigger, they hypothesized. Unfortunately, none of the experts were in the building and they had no idea how much trauma Jordan was experiencing at the moment. I was finally successful in persuading them to give her a mild sedative. And within 20 minutes, her sobs subsided and she fell asleep. Jeanette, my mom and I stood silent in the room. We watched over her - my beautiful girl. Seven years earlier she entered our lives and we knew how blessed we were when we first saw her. How cruel it seemed that she should spend this night here, like this.<br /><br />Jordan will be at the hospital through the weekend. Her core team of physicians will be back on Monday. We don&rsquo;t know how long Jordan will remain at CHLA. She is being given steroids intravenously to reduce any swelling in her head. We hope the medication will cause the trauma to subside. Her neurosurgeon and neuro-oncologist will have to decide whether to attempt another surgery (to remove the new tumor) or to change her chemotherapy. My guess is that they will opt for the latter, as the new tumor is very small. But there are many unanswered questions, and they may remain unanswered for some time.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-8413557844323854966?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Jordan,<br /><br />I was 22 when I met your mother. At the time, both of us were draped in polyester. We worked together as ushers at The Music Center and the uniforms left much to be desired in the way of fashion. Although, when it was cooler, the girls got to wear dark cloaks with crimson linings. Your mother looked beautiful in hers, like a character from one of the operas whose doors we guarded every night. I don&rsquo;t need to tell you that your mother can wear just about anything and make it look stylish. But that&rsquo;s not why I fell in love with her.<br /><br />I&rsquo;ve written you this letter because one day, many years from now, when you&rsquo;re more worried about which dress to wear to the prom or whether Billy Simms looked at you during math class (he&rsquo;s not good enough for you, by the way), you may not give a second thought as to how lucky you are to have the mom you do. You probably won&rsquo;t have the time to sit with me and let me tell you this story. I&rsquo;m  sure you&rsquo;ve long since determined that I&rsquo;m pretty square (but lovable in a nutty professor sort of way). So I&rsquo;ve written it all down for you. You may not remember all the details from when you were a sick kid and Mom gave you such great strength. You&rsquo;ll want to keep this handy, maybe even re-read it the next time you&rsquo;re thinking that your mother is on a mission to make your life hell. Truth is, ever since you were very small, you and your mother have butted heads. But whenever you were afraid, whenever you were hurting or feeling blue, she was the first one you ran to. I&rsquo;m about to tell you why.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />I confess, your mom wasn&rsquo;t my type. I had this inexplicable obsession with Italian girls. In my last year at college, I waxed poetic over a dark-haired Florentine named Cella who barely knew I existed. Actually, I fell in love with all things Italian, not just the girls. That&rsquo;s why when I graduated, I flew to Italy on an exchange program and planned to stay for a year. I&rsquo;d hoped to find a job with a theatre company and begin my career as a director and writer. I fantasized I&rsquo;d find a nice girl while I was there, too. Fortunately for you, my grand plan fell apart shortly after I arrived. I was forced to return to Los Angeles  feeling myself a total failure. It was a dreadful summer. I felt sorry for myself constantly and nearly drove your grandmother crazy. But by September I&rsquo;d had enough with self pity. I decided to move in with a couple of friends from college. I found a job as an usher at the Music Center - not a great job for a college grad - but it did get me close to the theatre. And that&rsquo;s  how I met your mother.<br /><br />What I most remember about our first meeting was how bossy she was. She had just been promoted to senior usher, and I think the power went to her head. She got to wear an ugly maroon uniform, while I had to settle for an ugly blue one. She kept her ushering &ldquo;zone&rdquo; under tight control. There she stood, all of five foot tall, not more than 90 pounds, wearing a modified sofa cover, and commanding four of us as though we were going into battle. The first time I worked with her I tried to strike up a conversation, but all I got out of her was quick, curt responses. One of my colleagues that night asked me what I thought of her. I said she was cute but really not my type. When he asked me why I responded, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s a little too serious &hellip; and blonde.&rdquo;<br /><br />It was your nina who matched us. The two of them were very close friends. Nina and I struck a friendship of our own and it was just a matter of time before she decided to put us together. We all went out after work most nights. One of those nights several of us sat around a table gossiping and I made an offhand wisecrack, something sarcastic and desperately clever. Your mother found it funny. Her eyes shaped themselves into wistful little crescents like they always do when she laughs. Her cheeks rose up to welcome that wide, warm smile she wears as comfortably as an old t-shirt. I remember thinking, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s pretty cute.&rdquo; I told your nina the same a few days later, and the rest, as they say, is history.<br /><br />Seven years later, you were born into our family. How your mother fawned over you! Late at night, when you&rsquo;d wake up crying, she&rsquo;d rock you and then bring you into our bed. You&rsquo;d nuzzle up close to her chest and the two of you would drift off to sleep looking so beautiful. I could always make you giggle but your mother was the one who gave you true comfort. It wasn&rsquo;t long, however, until you started testing her boundaries. I often laughed and teased your mom about the road ahead. She, a virgo with a fixed point of view on how to do things, and you a strong-willed Leo set on establishing who was boss. Do you know that when you were about five you used to walk through the house and proclaim that YOU were the queen? You were explicit in pointing out that mom was either a princess or a step-mother, but not the queen. You&rsquo;d quickly glance over to see if Mom took notice, a wry smile on your face. One Halloween you told Mom she should be a witch. Again, you said it with a grin, knowing it stuck your mom in the gut.<br /><br />And then you got sick.<br /><br />I was unprepared for your first hospital visit. You were in such pain and there was nothing we could do. I wanted to do my part, as a father and a husband. I volunteered to stay with you one night so that your mom could go home and rest. It was awful. You were having severe headaches all night. They woke you from sleep. The nurses gave you pain medication, but that only got you disoriented. I tried to hold your hand, but you pushed me away. I couldn&rsquo;t give you what you really needed. You wanted your mom. She arrived the next day looking very weary. She couldn&rsquo;t sleep at all being away from you. We decided from then on that she would stay at the hospital and I would look after Lucas. I felt bad that I couldn&rsquo;t relieve her, but she only wanted to be by your side. She slept in the bed with you at night, and you nuzzled next to her just like you did when you were a baby.<br /><br />Jordan, you must never forget how much you relied upon your mom. Perhaps the bond between you goes deeper than mother and daughter. As you know, your mom nearly died when she was an infant. For the first five years of her life she went in and out of hospitals, and she developed a strength that governed her actions for the rest of her life. Gram J calls her the iron butterfly. She looks very delicate on the surface, but try to crack her and you&rsquo;ll see how strong she really is. You wouldn&rsquo;t be who you are now without that strength. You wouldn&rsquo;t shine so bright without all the love she gave you.<br /><br />Hopefully, cancer is now a distant memory in your life. I hope you forget most of your illness. I hope you can&rsquo;t recall the debilitating surgeries and the countless tests. But I do hope you remember the way your mother loved you throughout it all. I hope you remember how when you were hurting and feeling lost it was her that you turned to to give you strength. She gave it to you effortlessly and unconditionally, served with generous amounts of love. No one drives her more crazy than you &hellip; but she will always be there when you need her. She has a character and an ability to uplift the soul that inspires me every day. And the seeds of these wonderful gifts lie in you. Let them bloom and return the gift.<br /><br />Love,<br />Dad</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-5291221683744324717?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jordan is doing well and working hard at the rehab clinic. Each day she follows a fast-paced, intensely regimented agenda of physical, occupational, and speech therapy. It&rsquo;s still too early to tell how much progress is being made, but we&rsquo;re getting a lot of good feedback from her physicians and specialists.<br /><br />The toll of being away from home so much is starting to show. She&rsquo;s still generally happy and upbeat, but she gets blue now and then. She&rsquo;s also started having a few more &ndash; as we lovingly refer to them &ndash; &ldquo;hissy fits&rdquo;, but she gets over it and finds playful ways to lift her spirits.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-478301332146768981?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jordan checked in to CHLA this afternoon. She&rsquo;s full of energy and seemingly unphased by life in the rehab clinic. She kept the staff laughing in the playroom and served up plenty of sass to cause one of the attendants to remark, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s got spunk.&rdquo;<br /><br />Tomorrow she&rsquo;ll begin a rigorous schedule. From 8:30am to noon she&rsquo;s booked solid with physical and occupational therapy. She gets a break from noon to 1:30, then it&rsquo;s back to work until 3:30. She&rsquo;ll have school lessons sprinkled in for good measure.<br /><br />If you&rsquo;re planning to visit her, evenings are best. Send me an email or call me to ensure she&rsquo;ll be around when you plan to stop by. She loves having visitors. Her grandparents stopped by tonight and she thought it was very cool.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-198915199064236579?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As expected, Jordan will return to Children&rsquo;s Hospital for rehabilitation. She&rsquo;s scheduled to check-in Monday after she finishes with chemotherapy. The rehab program can last for 3-6 weeks. She&rsquo;ll spend two uninterrupted weeks to kick off the program. After that she will remain inpatient from Sunday to Saturday until she regains the ability to walk on her own.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />We broke the news to Jordan last night. She took it well, but I sensed a bit of disappointment. When we sat down to dinner last night she asked to pray. This was what she prayed:<br /><br />&ldquo;God, thank you for my family &hellip; and Charlie and Abbie and my cousin Megan.&rdquo;<br /><br />Jeanette and I looked at each other, each feeling the lump in the other one&rsquo;s throat.<br /><br />This will be an easier visit to the hospital for Jordan than her previous stays. Fortunately, there will be no tubes connected to her body or constant vital checks from nurses in the middle of the night. But she will be away from her friends and family for an extended period of time, and unlike previous stays, she&rsquo;ll be very conscious throughout.<br /><br />We are so grateful to you, our friends, for your gestures of generosity and compassion these past few months. We have been particularly touched by the support of our friends at All Saints Church, who organized meal delivery every Monday so that Jeanette didn&rsquo;t have to worry about cooking on the days Jordan went in for chemo. Many of these friends were previously complete strangers to us &ndash; and their love and thoughtfullness has touched our lives. As Jordan rounds this next corner, we hope we can rely on you all to stop by or call Jordan and let her know she&rsquo;s not alone. Please help us encourage her and lighten her spirits. She&rsquo;s never needed her friends more than now.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-4412845468119545673?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Good news and discouraging news. I won&rsquo;t say bad news, because it really isn&rsquo;t.<br /><br />First, Jordan is doing so well emotionally. She is the happiest I&rsquo;ve seen her in months. She looks beautiful and healthy. It&rsquo;s hard not to feel warm when she&rsquo;s in the room.<br /><br />But she&rsquo;s not recovering as fast as we or her doctors would prefer. The chemo drug Vincristine did a number on her legs. The problem is that it hurts her to try walking, so she avoids doing it. Every day she avoids walking, the muscles in her legs get weaker.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />Outpatient physical therapy was increased to twice a week, but she&rsquo;s not progressing fast enough. It is very likely that the next phase for her treatment will be an inpatient therapy. She would check in to the hospital each Monday and then undergo five days of regimented physical therapy, occupational therapy and private tutoring. She&rsquo;d check out each Friday and be with her family for the weekend before returning to the hospital on Monday. The specialists think it will take at least three weeks to get her back up and walking again.<br /><br />As I said at the onset, it&rsquo;s not really bad news. I want to see Jordan on her feet. But I dread the thought of her being separated from her family for extended periods of time. She thrives on her family life. She enjoys badgering her cats. And she loves cuddling with her mom and dad. It&rsquo;s temporary, but it will be hard on her.<br /><br />We have not told her about this. It&rsquo;s not definite yet. But if she doesn&rsquo;t show signs of progress this week, it is very likely to be the next phase of treatment.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-7658967680233098163?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jordan went in for her monthly appointment with the lead oncologist. He was very pleased with her recovery. Since discontinuing the use of Vincristine, Jordan has bounced back on many fronts. Her speech is clearer. Her eyes are lively. And she glows again. The doctor noticed all of these factors and congratulated her on her progress. He also prescribed a new drug that may speed her physical recovery and help her walk again.<br /><br />For her part, Jordan was pleased to visit the hospital without getting poked with a needle. No labs were necessary this time around and she could not have been more ecstatic. When I arrived at home last night she was already in her comfiest pajamas cuddled into her bed playing with a flashlight. She bounced up and down when I sat down beside her.<br /><br />&ldquo;How was your visit with the doctor, Jordan?&rdquo;<br /><br />She managed to widen her smile &ndash; something I wouldn&rsquo;t have thought possible.<br /><br />&ldquo;It was great, Dad. It was great!&rdquo;</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-2655658672231327617?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy new year! Thank you to all who sent us well-wishes during the holiday season. I&rsquo;m sorry I haven&rsquo;t posted in awhile (or sent out any holiday cards). Between travel and the hustle that comes with the holidays I&rsquo;ve had little time to write.<br /><br /><img src="http://jordanvincent.com/wp-content/themes/deichnetz/pics/100_2672_1_1.jpg" alt="Jordan-Dec05" /><br />Jordan poses at a holiday tree lighting.<br /><br />Jordan is doing well. She&rsquo;s looking healthier than she did a month ago. She isn&rsquo;t walking again, but her memory is improving, her eyes have stopped drooping and her color has returned. She&rsquo;s doing physical therapy twice a week. Everyone is focused on getting her back on her legs and out of the wheelchair.<br /><br />The rest of the family is fine. There was really no time to rest during the holiday break, so Jeanette and I are giving thought to a weekend away &hellip; without the kids. It&rsquo;s just finding time to plan it that&rsquo;s proving problematic. I will write again soon.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-224629987518527410?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>An Open Letter to My Grandchildren</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Grandchild:<br /><br />When your mother was little, she listened to Chopin while she slept at night. She&rsquo;d say how she loved the quiet sound of the piano. Sometimes, I&rsquo;d peek in on her after she&rsquo;d fallen asleep. She looked so beautiful resting amongst her pink and purple sheets. She had soft, cream-kissed skin and flaxen-streaked hair. Cuddled up under her covers, arms strecthed out across her pillow, she reminded me of a water-colored illustration from a children&rsquo;s book &ndash; too picturesque to be real.<br /><br />It may be hard to imagine your mom this way. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m writing you this letter. You see, I understand what you&rsquo;re going through because I went through it, too. Your mom&rsquo;s a tough old broad. And I want you to know she was just as tough when she was seven. Though I&rsquo;m not around to help you out anymore, I want you to promise me that you will look after her always. Be patient, understanding and kind with her. Because as cantankerous as she may get at times, rattling off complaints and barking commands, there&rsquo;s a beautiful little girl inside who had to grow up awfully fast.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />I hope your children are always healthy. May you never see them suffer. Children are a gift of song. When that song is quieted, when it wanes or falters in its pitch, you realize how deeply it is rooted in your heart. Its absence deafens.<br /><br />There was a girl once, only four years old, who had the most vibrant smile I&rsquo;d ever seen. When she spoke her eyes widened to sing out blue. She smiled often, raising cheekbones to the skies, showing dainty teeth in the curve of her miraculous mouth. She laughed so hard it tickled others. And she spoke with wit &ndash; a wit so vibrant people would stop and admire the verse that streamed from her cupid-bow lips. This was your mom &ndash; a bubbly, dreamy, charming girl.<br /><br />Then came the cancer. I never cried so much as when your mom was sick. My little girl, so sick. She was remarkably strong. For a long time she soldiered on, determined to get better. And she did get better. But the cancer changed her. She grew tired. I remember looking at her one night while she lay asleep. Chopin lingered and cast a melancholy hue. Your mom was thin and pale and very weak. The cancer robbed her of energy. It crippled her for awhile, forcing her to crawl from room to room and go to school in a wheelchair. It shuttered her marvelous eyes. The lids opened grudgingly. Her smile faded, only hinting at its brilliance. And the words that once rolled so eloquently off her tongue, they mixed together and slushed out in incomprehensible expressions.<br /><br />She was very cranky then, mostly taking out her frustration on your uncle. She was never satisfied. She blamed him for just about everything. If her food was cold it was Lucas&rsquo; fault. If she couldn&rsquo;t find her favorite book, she was certain Lucas had lost it. If not one thing, it was another. Sometimes he ignored her and sometimes they went at it, throwing a boisterous row that me or your Gram would have to end.  She was cranky with us, too. At the hospital she&rsquo;d sass us and order us about. She often went too far, speaking to us disrespectfully. We tried to keep her in her place, but sometimes we let her be a bitch. Yes, I said it. I know you&rsquo;ve thought it (but never said it, because your mom raised you properly). That girl has an uncanny gift for bitching.<br /><br />So, this is why I&rsquo;m writing to you. I know what a pill your mom can be. And as she&rsquo;s getting older I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s getting more difficult. She doesn&rsquo;t like the things she cannot control, and aging, I&rsquo;m afraid, is uncontrollable. She needs you. She loves you. She&rsquo;s earned the right to be a bit hard around the edges. If you knew what she&rsquo;s been through, if you saw the raw courage she mustered, if you were there to see her body possessed by seizures or beleagured by chemicals, you would understand why she occasionally blasts bully with words. But she loves you. She loves her family and she thrives on life. Give her both in ample doses.<br /><br />You have always known her as a strong woman. She has succeeded beyond anyone&rsquo;s expectations. She is bright, ambitious and bursting with character. But there was a time when much of her life was in doubt. There was once concern that she might not ever be able to have children of her own. But look in the mirror and see that life has its own way of interpreting prophecy. Your mother is a wonderful, buoyant spirit. Aging will not come easy to her, yet she will do it with her own grace and in spite of convention. I cannot comfort her now, but she doesn&rsquo;t need me. She has you. Ignore her biting insults. Appease her relentless requests. Hold her hand and run your fingers over her wrinkled fingers. Tell her that you love her. Look deep into her wise and restless eyes to find the little girl who happily slept to the tinkling of Chopin, and tell her a simple joke while sitting close by her side. Then tell her that I love her, too.<br /><br />I know that you will make me proud as your mother has made me before. And when  you are frustrated and feeling exhausted because she&rsquo;s being difficult, think of me and your Gram. Think of us standing by you, encouraging you to take a deep breath and count to three. We&rsquo;ll be there with you, while you make the old broad happy. And she&rsquo;ll be there for you throughout the days of your life.<br /><br />Thank you for taking care of our little girl.<br /><br />Love,<br />Grandpa</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-137543981453052848?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I despise running. Never understood the enthusiasm of runners. I hit the streets and break into a jog and count the minutes until it is over, lungs burning, legs aching, attention span taxed. I finish a lap and wonder what I&rsquo;m missing.<br /><br />There&rsquo;s a psychology to running &ndash; long-distance running. I haven&rsquo;t fully experienced it, but I gather the gist from the tales of my running friends. The psychology of running is rooted in a self-induced conflict, where the mind and body battle for control. The mind forces the body to run, and the body bullies the mind in an effort to make it stop. When the finish line is crossed, the soul is rewarded; body rests, mind exalts.<br /><br />Fighting a brain tumor is a long-distance run. It requires patience. The body resists the battle. And the rewards hide along the margins. Defeating a brain tumor requires the psychology of a runner: determination, coping mechanisms and indulgent courage.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />Jordan has been running for nearly three years. She has the mettle of a triathlete. Today, she reaped some reward, but found it hard to celebrate.<br /><br />She went in for an MRI today. The results provided reprieve. One of the tumors is smaller, nearly invisible. The pesky nodule that surfaced earlier this year and caused so much alarm is now a radiological ghost. But the larger mass remains, shadowing cause for too much hand-slapping.<br /><br />Still, a milestone is a milestone. Chalk one up for Jordan.<br /><br />She refuses to acknowledge her accomplishment. Her oncologist smiled as he delivered the news. Then he invited us into another room to view the scans firsthand. He imagined Jordan would want to see the progress. He was wrong. She fidgeted and whined, clawing for the door. Later, she would say that seeing pictures of her brain freaked her out. I suppose giving shape to her opponent made the race too real. It interrupted the psychology of the run.<br /><br />The toll of her marathon shows. She is thin, pale and tired. Vincristine, one of the two agents in her chemotherapy protocol, has weakened her body, robbing her of the ability to walk normally, drooping her eyes, thinning her hair and sapping much of her energy. She will take a break from this drug for a little while while she continues to receive Carbo-Platina, the other cancer-fighting drug that drips into her veins each Monday morning.<br /><br />We were relieved to hear positive news. Late Tuesday night, Jeanette and I tossed and turned in bed, finally confessing our mutual apprehension. We hoped for positive reinforcement, but expected the status quo. As it turned out, we had a little of both. A monster is slain, but the demonic progenitor hovers up and down her spinal chord and envelopes her brain. This will be a very long journey, and Jordan must pysch herself into a methodical gate, resisting the mental urge to just stop running.<br /><br />When our family began this journey, we imagined how lucky we were. We rationalized that because her symptoms were minor, she was better off. We ignored the obvious signs that indicated the seriousness of her illness. We marginalized two brain surgeries, the onset of seizures, chemotherapy and the deterioration of her faculties.<br /><br />Today, we struggle with the realization that she is riddled with disease. We caution ourselves against false hope, taking each day as it comes and rejoicing when Jordan serves a victory. Today, we allowed ourselves a sigh of relief, but only long enough to rest our souls and trick our minds to continue on. Perhaps I should reconsider taking up running.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-8549345384547751706?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[“What’s my time again, Dad?”

Lucas kept his eye on the pool, his swim cap a wee bit big for his head. It scrunched his eyebrows into an involuntary look of perplexity.

“1:15:24,” I replied. “Remember to ask the timers how you did when you pull out of the water.”

He nodded, still watching the current competitors as they finished their final strokes and tagged the wall. The PA announced his heat.

“1:15:24,” he mumbled.

I wished him luck and watched him take his mark. His stalwart mind readied to compete. His eyes looked to the starter, apt and buoyant. At the starting signal, his body surged into the pool. He butterflied for 50 yards, keeping up with the other swimmers for the first 25, then tiring on the return stretch. He finished dead last. But he did so at 1:12:56. He shaved nearly three seconds from his time. In fact, he shaved time off of all of his races that day. And his number one cheerleader was the peppy girl sitting in the wheelchair along the pool deck.

If not for the swim meet, we might not have taken our weekend holiday. It was a special meet converging in Palm Springs. Ordinarily, his club doesn’t travel that far, and many of his friends were absent. But Luc wanted to compete and he was the one who suggested a family getaway.

Fate seemed to be conspiring against us. My travel schedule called me away late in the week. We refused to cancel. Jeanette and the kids drove out to Palm Springs on their own Friday afternoon and I joined them late that night. Then there was the issue of Jordan’s health. Her ability to walk has steadily declined. She can maneuver around the house with only a few falls, but it takes a lot of effort. By Friday, a wheelchair was delivered to help her out. She had barely time to get it adjusted before it was packed up for travel.

She’s excited about her newest accoutrement. She hasn’t quite figured out how to get around on her own, but she tries. We encourage her to walk as much as she can, reminding her that the chair is temporary. Still, she uses it as yet another power base for her bossy side. Sometimes it’s hard not to compare her to the late Agnes Demille, barking orders from the wheelchair while primping herself with fashion.

The presence of the chair can be unsettling, another reminder that my daughter is sick. When I arrived Firday night I tiptoed into the kids room to tuck them in. Jordan lay curled up under the sheets, surrounded by pillows. The empty wheelchair loomed a few feet away, a haunting, solitary bedfellow.

Luc, Jeanette and I each took turns at doing tricks with it. Jordan enjoyed watching each of us try. Luc had the best moves. When he demonstrated how well he could back it into a tight space, Jordan looked at me and said, “he’s the best brother!” A few minutes later she berated him for touching her as he pounced onto his bed. She rarely expresses her gratitude for him directly. But we reconvey the praise to him on our own, and you can sense the quiet pride behind his eyes whenever he hears it.

Business travel has its benefits. As a result of my loyalty to the Starwood hotel chain, our family was treated like royalty. We were upgraded to the presidential suite, an act that enlivened the children. It was a great blessing which we exploited to the fullest. When we returned from the meet in the early afternoon, we ordered out for room service and enjoyed a rare family dinner around the private dining table. The sliding doors opened to a sweeping veranda as we dined in the mild, warm air. Later, we fed ducks from the porch and swam lazily in the pool.

Next week Jordan gets another MRI. We’ll cross our fingers in hope that the chemotherapy is beginning to do its job. It has affected so much of her body, it seems natural that it should also affect the tumor. But we fear the prospect of disappointing news. It’s a slow process. While Jordan fights the disease with verve and sass, we must be grateful for our time together and celebrate her perseverance.

It’s time for my annual thanksgiving appeal. Cancer treatment has come a long way. Only a few years ago, a child like Jordan would face a far more daunting prognosis. Thanks to the efforts of researchers and scientists around the world, we can help Jordan enjoy her childhood and speak about her future. But more work is needed. We need drugs and therapies that can improve the quality of life for children afflicted by cancer. Please join our family in supporting worthy causes such as the <a href="http://www.laf.org" target="_blank">Lance Armstrong Foundation</a> and <a href="http://www.childrenshospitalla.org/body.cfm?id=9" target="_blank">Children’s Hospital Los Angeles</a>. Thank you.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Her counts were good when she went for labs this week, so she&rsquo;s back on chemotherapy. She ran a slight fever Tuesday night. The medical team pulled her from school as a precaution and she has not returned.<br /><br />She has a lot of trouble walking. She continues to lose her footing and fall often, but it&rsquo;s her stride that&rsquo;s most affected now. She walks awkwardly, with heavy steps. Her arms extend so that she can catch her balance and use furniture to steady herself. She doesn&rsquo;t move quickly and it takes all of her concentration to get from one point to another. She often asks us to carry her.<br /><br />The medical team is considering prescribing a wheelchair for use at school. Everyone is concerned that she will hurt herself. When she&rsquo;s with her peers she overdoes it. The flip side is that a wheelchair could weaken her legs. Moving around keeps the muscles strong.<br /><br />The family goes away to Palm Springs this weekend. Lucas has a swim meet and we plan to take some time to lounge by the pool. Jordan loves swimming and playing in the water. It should be therapeutic for all of us.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-8664652501450646210?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Traveling with a Contrarian</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There was fanfare. There was ballyhoo. It was our own undertaking of &ldquo;Make a Wish&rdquo; &hellip; sort of. Last weekend, Jordan, Jeanette and I indulged in a Manhattan retreat while Luc happily slept over with friends. The trip was planned for more than a year. Under normal circumstances, it would have just been me and Jordan. I often bring one of the kids along on my business travels. They enjoy spending the time alone with me and it&rsquo;s usually easy to book a sitter in my regular travel circuit. Negotiating with Jordan to allow Jeanette to accompany us was far from easy (she could run a law firm one day). She only acquiesced after I agreed to fund a &ldquo;girls&rsquo; only&rdquo; shopping day on Fifth Avenue.<br /><br /><img src="http://larry.gelosi.com/wp-content/themes/deichnetz/pics/100_2592_1.jpg" /><br />The Vincent girls lounge at the Westin.<br /><br />It was well over a year ago that I originally suggested a New York itinerary to Jordan. I promised shopping, gallery hopping and a Broadway show. We agreed to go in the autumn, when the trees were painted with her favorite colors â€“ perfect for a stroll through Central Park. But then she got sick last October and our plans were deferred. I was determined to get her to New York in the autumn this year.<br /><br />The timing was not perfect. Her immune system is still weak, too weak to restart chemotherapy. She is susceptible to illness, which makes travel by air unattractive. Thankfully, the team at CHLA believes in treating â€œthe whole childâ€. They cleared her to go because they believed it was just as critical to her well-being as getting chemotherapy. They stipulated a few conditions, but gladly granted her leave.<br /><br />To quote Dickens, the weekend was &ldquo;the best of times. It was the worst of times.&rdquo; Jordan is a captivating presence. She is charming, witty and prone to unsolicited shows of affection. She wears her heart on her sleeve and surprises us with quaint sentiments like the way she described her mother to me Friday.<br /><br />â€œIsnâ€™t mom a precious dear,â€ she asked rhetorically.<br /><br />I stared blankly, uncertain if I was speaking to a seven year-old child or a Victorian matron channeled through the spirit realm.<br /><br />But like all of us, Jordan has an alter-ego. She can be obstinate, dramatic and downright contrary. While easy to overlook these &ldquo;minor flaws&rdquo;, there are moments when they apparate in a fashion so forceful that her behavior seems positively wicked. During our four-day sojourn together, both personalities emerged. Iâ€™ll be honest. She is not an easy travel companion. The fault is not entirely due to her personality.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />It was a grand weekend in many respects. She shopped. She dined. She saw __The Lion King__ and enjoyed a ride on a horse-drawn cab through Central Park. She was a vision in pink Saturday night &ndash; sporting a blushing plaid mini-skirt, iridescent polka-dot tights and a dusty rose-colored overcoat all acquired on her first trip to Bloomingdales. She accessorized with leopard spotted flat shoes, each accented with a pink bow. A veteran New Yorker stopped her on 43rd street to admire the ensemble. Jordan curtseyed slightly to show the shoes in better light. New York is a city she could grow to love, and I suspect it could end up loving her, too.<br /><br />The City&rsquo;s brash invincibility, often colored proud and defiant, suits her well. The one travel condition required of her was to wear a surgical mask on the plane ride. CHLA advised us to change the mask several times during the five-hour flight. She was allowed to remove it to eat. But Jordan had other plans. Once we boarded the flight, we lost our leverage and she demanded her way. She refused to wear it and held us hostage with the threat of tantrum. I reasoned with her. I tried to conjure guilt. I even contemplated hard-wiring the damn thing on to her face, but it was all in vain. Her heels lock down quite firmly.<br /><br />She has become quite good at being served &ndash; perhaps too good. It&rsquo;s natural. Everyone wants to help her, mom and dad included. Now she expects people to do things she is quite capable of doing herself, like picking up dirty clothes, finding her shoes or brushing her teeth. I&rsquo;m such a sucker for my daughter that I would gladly do them all, but for the distastefulness of her new attitude. She doesn&rsquo;t ask much anymore. She commands. She has developed too close of an affection for Eloise, whom she delighted to learn lived a few blocks down Fifth Avenue at the Plaza.<br /><br />But nothing is more frustrating than her dominating need for control. Everything must be executed on her terms. When you concede, she is still unhappy. If you tell her that she is beautiful, she will argue that she is not. If you tell her that it is morning, she will argue that it is night. Her contrarian nature is rarely satisfied. It is maddening. By weekend&rsquo;s end, we were exhausted.<br /><br />And yet, it&rsquo;s easy to see why she labors for such control. That same insistence to assert her will is what keeps her going, particularly when her body does not cooperate. New York is a fast moving city. Jordan could not keep apace. She walks with difficulty, a normal side effect of chemotherapy. Chemo patients often have difficulty &ldquo;clearing their feet&rdquo;. It is noticeable to even the casual observer, but Jordan ignores it and refuses to discuss it. Steps are a significant challenge that require all her attention and effort. But even when sheâ€™s not on a staircase she is at risk. She fell several times during our travels on flat surfaces. Iâ€™d hear the inevitable thud behind me and look back to see her splayed out on the sidewalk. Itâ€™s a blow to her confidence more than it is to her backside.<br /><br />It&rsquo;s also a blow to us. Sitting across from her at dinner Saturday night, I thought, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s so frail.&rdquo; Her hands trembled as she reached for her cup of tea. She worked hard to take a drink without spilling on herself. Her eyes sagged, making her look a little drunk or like she was too tired to let them fully open. She said some funny things. The remarks made us and others laugh, but I was often uncertain that she meant them to be witty. Still, she never acknowledged a slip. She just smiled and proceeded on.<br /><br />Fortunately, we are told that many of these side effects will dissipate when she regains her health. Conversations with other survivors confirm the diagnosis. Mobility impairments, like loss of hair, pass with time.<br /><br />Our holiday was a taxing but rewarding experience. I will never forget the delight in Jordan&rsquo;s face at the theatre. She clapped after every number. She sang along to &ldquo;Can You Feel The Love Tonight&rdquo;. And when the show was ended, she leapt to her feet to give her very first (unprompted) standing ovation. Later that night, she enjoyed the fancy cab ride through the park. In the many years I&rsquo;ve traveled to the City, I&rsquo;ve never once wanted to ride in a smelly horse-drawn cab. But watching Jordan sigh under a red velvet blanket, as the autumn night air tussled her blonde locks, and the City cradled her with light, I was grateful for her stubborn insistence.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-2949059493667451458?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Exhaustion got the best of her. Two days at the hospital in the same week. The pace of treatment and logistics and unknowing sapped all her energy. When the alarm sounded at 6am, nearly five minutes passed before Jeanette slapped the snooze. I was away, and my wife was tired.

Luc woke before dawn. The act of waking early makes him proud. He climbed down from his bunk and dressed as the sun peaked over the San Gabriels to the east. Jordan was still asleep. He sauntered into the living room and enjoyed the quiet as pink light fought the Venetian blinds to invade the flat. Awhile later, his sister awoke and joined him. He fixed their breakfast: toast, oatmeal and tea. By the time Jeanette had lost the battle with the alarm clock, the kids were fed, dressed and managing the morning on their own – thanks to Lucas. He was late to school, but for once his mother was grateful. The boy often rises to the occasion.<a name="more"></a>

Maybe he is not the cool, quiet cowboy of the mythic western epic, but he is reserved and collected at times. He listens with his eyes. While he chatters rampantly about wondrous inventions, his eyes catch the unsaid and his brain meticulously records and considers his observations. He knows the gravity of his sister’s situation, yet he doesn’t speak of it. Attempts to frankly address the changes in her health are summarily dismissed. But his eyes watch on.

Tonight, she couldn’t sleep. Around 9:30 she wandered into the living room with a glum look on her face. She said her stomach hurt. She curled into a ball on my lap and whined about trivial inconveniences for a few minutes.

“Dad”

“Yes.”

“I don’t like when they take my blood.”

I ran my fingers through her thinning hair. Bald patches are forming on the left side of her head.

“Honey, they don’t take much,” I consoled. “You know why they need to take it, right?”

“No”

I explained why it was necessary for her to visit the hospital each week, what they did with the sample of blood they collected, and how the medicine they gave her through the IV fought her cancer. She didn’t move, just pulled at the hair on my arms. Something inside me told me it was a good time to address the bigger question.

“Jordan, what are we going to do when you lose your hair? Do you think you’ll want a wig, or will you just want to wear hats?”

I held my breath while she pondered the question. She didn’t move. About a week before, Jeanette told Jordan that some kids on chemotherapy lose their hair. Jordan listened but didn’t say anything.

The tugging on my arm hair continued.

“I think I’ll just wear hats,” she said without the slightest hint of self-pity. Then she added, “what did I look like when I was bald?”

I told her that she was the most beautiful baby – told her that her grandmother had remarked that she had the most perfectly shaped head she’d ever seen. And then I reminded her that whatever happened to her hair, it would grow back.

Tears welled in my eyes, but I fought them back. Jordan cuddled closer and told me that she loved me. I choked back the urge to say something sappy, paused and collected my thoughts. Then I told her that I loved her, too.

After a few minutes, I walked her back to her room. She grinned as I rolled her into her bunk and covered her with sheets. I kissed her on the forehead and straightened to leave the room, until I saw Lucas sitting up in his bunk. He wore a discerning, crooked smile. His eyes probed for signs of my emotion. They hinted at a deeper knowing. I wondered if he heard me talking to Jordan, but thought it unlikely. We were practically whispering and music was playing in the background. But somehow, I had the distinct feeling he knew more than he was telling.

He peered at me with a gaze wiser than his age. I wanted to say something, but nothing seemed right. So I reached out and stretched my hand around the back of his neck. We locked eyes for a moment while my thumb stroked his platinum locks of hair. Then I said good night.

Four of us travel the journey. Four of us. And sometimes, the quietest of all have the greatest tale to tell.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Her counts hit the danger zone, as expected. Hemoglobin and white cells are down &ndash; so far down that she had to skip chemo this week and she&rsquo;s not allowed to return to school until her immune system recovers. She has to wear a mask when she leaves the house. Wednesday, she goes back to CHLA for a blood transfusion (my blood was still at the lab today), which will hopefully give her system a boost and restore her energy.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />The news hit me harder than I expected. When I checked voicemail and heard it from Jeanette my stomach sank. I suppose it is because, once again, I&rsquo;m on the road 2,000 miles away and Jordan&rsquo;s health has hit another speed bump.<br /><br />On the flight, I sat next to a nurse on her way to help Katrina victims in Louisiana. I rarely talk to my seat-mate, but this woman was disarmingly friendly. As I talked to her about Jordan, I found myself trying to be upbeat. When I finished sputtering on about how tough my daughter is and how well we&rsquo;re handling it all, I looked over across the seat. The woman&rsquo;s facial expression told me she didn&rsquo;t buy it. She smiled knowlngly. Then she told me to pray because miracles __can__ happen. She said she sees them every day.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-1910841289967915800?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Update &ndash; Jordan did not need a transfusion today, but she will probably need one next week. I am contributing a pint today, which will be ready for her use when she goes in next for labs. Many of you responded to my last email. Thank you. We are putting a schedule together for blood banking. It&rsquo;s a perishable substance and you can only give once every 55 days. Since it is unlikely she will need blood every week, we&rsquo;re going to put a grid together and if we find ourselves short, we&rsquo;ll let you know. Thanks again for your offers and your well wishes.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-3378257338763427139?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My phone chimed. It was an email from Jeanette.<br /><br />&ldquo;Jordan did great.&rdquo;<br /><br />A tiny smile expanded to a broad smile on my face. The girls were back at CHLA this morning to restart Jordan&rsquo;s chemotherapy after a four-week break. Sometimes Jordan gets anxious about being accessed through her port. We spent a lot of time over the weekend prepping her. Each time she&rsquo;s accessed she has a chance to win prizes Nettie collects in advance. All she has to do is follow some simple  steps: look away, relax, breathe. If she does everything well, she earns the prize.<br /><br />Jeanette&rsquo;s email let me know that Jordan passed with flying colors. It was a relief - one less thing to worry about on a busy Monday.<br /><br />But I exhaled too early. About an hour later Jeanette called to tell me that Jordan&rsquo;s speech was slurring. She was apparently having mild seizures at the hospital. A cat scan has been ordered and she&rsquo;s under observation.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />I chalk it up to the October curse. It was nearly two years ago that we were dealt the news that Jordan had cancer. Last year at this time, she began having serious side effects from the chemotherapy. Now, despite all her progress, despite weeks of cheeriness and wellness, the curse is back.<br /><br />There was a time when October was my favorite month on the calendar.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-4562370354736308079?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know you love the girl when you can close your eyes and picture her, riding belted in the car with a brimming grin and a chatty verse. You know you&rsquo;re smitten when you can imagine her vivid blue eyes smiling in a landscape of noise and all you can do is sigh. When the sound of her giggle moves you to lower your head and grin, you&rsquo;re hexed.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />Her eyes gush with life. And I don&rsquo;t care to think of them in the past tense. Yet sometimes it crosses my mind. Sometimes I feel blessed to have her here with me now. I&rsquo;m not supposed to think these thoughts. Of course she&rsquo;ll outlive me. Of course, she&rsquo;ll be the healthiest in the clan. It&rsquo;s all probably true. Still, she takes me. I can imagine her. I appreciate what she radiates. I revel in the soft touch of her hand and the sass in her voice.<br /><br />I have this indulgent habit of making CDs for my girls. I&rsquo;ll spend hours hand-picking songs to burn onto a disc that they enjoy on their weekly trips to and from Children&rsquo;s Hospital for chemotherapy and physical therapy. Inevitably, I&rsquo;ll stumble across a song that hits a little too close to home. Tonight it was Patrick &amp; Eugene&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Birds and the Bees.&quot; You may not know it by name, but you&rsquo;ve probably heard it in the new Volkswagen Rabbit commercial. I thought it would be a whimsical end to my latest spin masterpiece. And it is, except when I played it back, I started crying. The emotion poured over me like the first sip of a good wine. It was pleasant, and intoxicating. I pictured my girls riding around in Nettie&rsquo;s Jeep Liberty, both of them smiling. I pictured Jordan in the back seat singing along, only getting every few couple of words &ndash; a habit that annoys her brother. And I could not control the sobs.<br /><br />I love this child. She is filled with a charm that overwhelms my senses. She is stylish and sincere, innocent and wily, spirited and fragile.  I cherish growing with her and imagining her in many life situations. I dream of her as a teenager, mother, and grandmother. I am filled with anxiety that my dreams are vaporous &ndash; that every memory and observation is precious and must be perfectly archived so that one day I can tell others about her. I hate that feeling. It&rsquo;s the lingering scent of reality that every so often invades the vision of the girl; the muse. It&rsquo;s the theory of predestination applied to our family life &ndash; a sense of meaning and purpose rendered empty by the threat of absence.<br /><br />I never know what to do with this feeling, so I tuck it away, until it will not recess.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-5734877351333318723?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The journey did not begin with cancer. It did not begin with tumors or with headaches or with stealthy genetic malfunctions waiting to emerge. In truth, its origins reach further back than the birth of my daughter. The journey began some 89 years ago, when a country girl named June first greeted the world with strong lungs and a cry of perseverance.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />She was the youngest of three sisters who she would outlive by more than 20 years. Her family was so poor that she recalled ramshackle breakfasts fashioned from a slice of bread, sugar and warm coffee. She suffered embarassment at school when she was the only child not to have a lunch. But she held her head up. She never surrendering her dignity without a fight.<br /><br />When she was just 16, she experienced the first of her life&rsquo;s many challenges. Out for a joyride with her sister and two gentlemen callers, they were struck by a train when their car stranded on the tracks. One of the boys died. She spent the rest of the year in a hospital bed. A bright girl, who wrote well and read often, she abandoned school forever when her condition slowed her studies. She kept her dignity and persevered.<br />She later married a farmer, and they raised eight children, two of them his from a previous marriage. Her first-born, a buoyant boy named Bobby, drowned in a swimming accident when he was still a child. She would never shake the tragedy from her memory and she would develop a fear of water, but again she persevered.<br /><br />She endured many more tests along the path of her long life. Her husband died too young and left her alone to raise the two youngest of their children. A few years later, she nearly died from a rare intestinal illness. Again, she persevered &hellip; with dignity.<br /><br />Last year on this day, June Rose Callihan, my grandmother and Jordan&rsquo;s great grandmother, passed away. She was a beautiful, gifted woman who blessed the lives of her friends and family. She was an inspiration to those who knew her, and she was loved by many.<br /><br />When I look into my daughter&rsquo;s eyes, I see the fire started by June Callihan. When I watch her stand tall and cross the room with legs still struggling to walk, I see June&rsquo;s thirsty perseverance. When I sit and talk with Jordan and hear the flirtatious girl with the passion for life, I hear the whispers of June&rsquo;s spirit. When I help Jordan read a book, as she tries desperately to preserve her dignity because all the letters look like a jumble of squigly lines and the words unclear, I sense the dignity of my grandmother.<br /><br />June&rsquo;s journey is over, but it inspires Jordan&rsquo;s. My daughter grows stronger every day. I believe her journey&rsquo;s path runs parallel to June&rsquo;s, along a river of hope that gives them cool repose and constant direction. Like June, Jordan will persevere with dignity, with purpose, and with an abundance of love.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-8148570005397128688?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A Boy and His Dog</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[He wanted a dog. The feeling welled up when his bare feet walked across the taunting wet grass. It tickled when he sat on the sofa and imagined a panting, slobbering friend at his feet. It called to him when he lay on his bed and closed his eyes and imagined playing catch with an energetic bundle of muscle and fir. The boy wanted a dog.

Oh, and Luc wanted one, too.<!--more-->

It’s been nearly eight years since our family owned a dog. Dogs need attention and space, and we had little of either in recent years. When we moved to our new house last spring, the first thing Luc asked for was a dog. Jeanette told him that it might happen in the future, but for the moment “we’ve had enough life change.” Secretly, in the back of my head, I thought, “hmm, a doooog!”

We’re settled in our home now, and the yearning for a canine of our own only grew. I call it my dog call. It’s a cosmic, boy-loves-dog hankering that just won’t go away, whispering in my head, “wouldn’t a dog be nice about now?”

A few months ago, I started planting a seed. I’d hint my ambition to Jeanette. I’d browse breeder sites and call her over. “Isn’t this a beautiful dog?” I’d ask. At first, she’d pat me on the back and go back to her magazine. But gradually she came around. I’d walk into the family room and find her researching breeds … even taking notes.

And Luc, contrary to character, had patience. He didn’t nag. He didn’t beg. He played his own game of subtle hints. We’d watch him with other people’s dogs and note how well he behaved with them. His smile was different when he was with a dog. Deep inside, I saw myself.

Yesterday, our new dog came home. His name is Jed. He’s an adult cattle dog. Our cats aren’t very pleased, but the rest of the family is giddy. We opted for an adult dog because between chemo schedules for Jordan and the active lifestyle that is a family of four, we thought puppy training might be over-doing it. Some of our friends thought we were crazy to adopt a working dog, but I grew up with the breed and we have friends who are cattle dog enthusiasts. It just seemed right, from the moment we first met him three weeks ago.

I take a walk every morning, hiking the hills around our house. It’s my favorite time of the day. The sun peaks out about 6am, revealing the valley below. The air is calm, and neighbors are friendly. There’s a touch of Wisteria Lane, but it’s quite satisfying. This morning, it was even more so. Jed walked calmly by my side for nearly an hour. By the time I was home, Luc had risen early. After a quick breakfast, I watched him work the dog in the backyard, playing fetch. Though Jed belongs to the family, I can’t help but think us two boys are on this new journey together – two boys and a dog.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jordan is doing better. Her speech is only slightly slurred. She&rsquo;s alert and feeling good.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />I rolled out of bed at my usual time this morning, threw on some old workout clothes and headed out for my daily walk. Before I left, I tiptoed into Jordan&rsquo;s room. She slept through the night balled up under the sheets, only a tassle of hair peeking from the folds.<br /><br />I worried, how would she be today. Would she still act so disoriented? Would she cry constantly and struggle to tell us what was wrong? Would her left side be as weak as it was yesterday, alarming her when she couldn&rsquo;t grasp her crayons or when a bit of drool escaped her lips without her knowledge.<br /><br />These thoughts ran through my mind as I wandered our neighborhood in the wet morning air. I tried to take my mind off the situation. &ldquo;Hope for the best,&rdquo; I thought. I turned my attention to the hills, attacking them at a brisker pace than I normally would, stomping all my frustration into the pavement, sweating all the anger.<br /><br />An hour later I was really tired. My hands shook some as I turned the lock on our front door. But when I opened it, there she was, sitting at the dining room table eating a frozen waffle.<br /><br />&ldquo;Dad, I&rsquo;m having two waffles because I didn&rsquo;t have any dinner? Charlie doesn&rsquo;t like waffles does he? I cut this one by myself. Aren&rsquo;t you proud of me, Dad?&rdquo;<br /><br />I couldn&rsquo;t cry yesterday &ndash; too filled with anger &ndash; but I was choking them back this morning. Once again, the youngest of our clan proved to be the strongest. I fixed her eggs and sausage and her favorite vanilla tea. She chattered on while we ate our breakfast. She talked about her upcoming birthday between sips of tea. Her memory is better. She struggles to recall minor details, but she was able to tell us more about her day yesterday. She is not sad.<br /><br />As is often the case, I now turn my worries to Luc. Last night he pretended nothing was wrong and acted upbeat. He lingered near my desk much of the night. I think he was spying on me. He spent far too much time picking through the fridge and he often asked me how I was doing. Jeanette and I think he was pretty freaked out by Jordan&rsquo;s condition. When she got sick this way last year, he was away with friends on a long weekend. He never witnessed the seizures or the agitation. Yesterday, when she could not remember his name, I think it opened his eyes. He saw how nasty the tumors can be.<br /><br />Today, he is quiet. Jordan is so chatty and so markedly different from yesterday, I think he&rsquo;s having trouble piecing it all together. We&rsquo;ll keep an eye on them both. Meanwhile, I am happy to have my breakfast mate back on the job.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-5546990789780019530?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We rushed Jordan to the emergency room at CHLA today. She tripped, fell and hit her head while she was at summer camp. She seemed fine at first, but then the staff noticed a change in her behavior. She became agitated. Her speech slurred together. When Jeanette arrived to pick her up, Jordan was clearly frightened. She knew what was happening. Her brain was letting her down again.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />I arrived at the hospital before the girls did. I sat in the lobby staring out of the giant windows shaking my head. Not again. Please, don&rsquo;t let it be happening again.<br /><br />The first time Jordan suffered from seizures was on August 20th, 2005 &ndash; her seventh birthday. It was nearly a year ago today that she tripped over a light post in Old Town and bumped her head on the pavement. Within hours she was in and out of consciousness and seemingly possessed. Now, here she was, back again.<br /><br />What made it worse was the knowledge of the past. From the moment Jordan arrived at CHLA today, she was pleading to go home. In fact, we brought her back tonight even though she&rsquo;s still not well. She was so anxious at the hospital that she was doing herself more harm there than good. Her CT scan was clean &ndash; no hemhoraging, no shunt occlusion, no changes in tumor size or shape. But she has lost some control of her left hand. Her words are barely recognizable. Her eyes are slightly dialated and scan anxiously.<br /><br />For me, the worst part is watching her fight her body. She leaps out of bed onto wobbly legs, whimpering, headed nowhere. It seems she&rsquo;s trying to prove to herself that she can still walk. When she tries to talk and the words don&rsquo;t come out right, her eyes reveal how troubled she must feel inside. She vacilates between wanting to be held and pushing away.<br /><br />The doctor believes she will gradually improve in the next few days. We believe she will be acting like her old self soon enough. She&rsquo;s resting now.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-6459618949346656925?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>8am on a promising Saturday morning. The kids and I fix breakfast and debate the latest in animated movies with our mouths half-full of homemade waffles. Nettie sleeps in. I peak in on her. The sheets are pulled to her chin, her head burrowed into the pillow. The kids head off to their respective rooms while I open the patio doors in our family room to welcome the warm morning air. Joni Mitchell incants &ldquo;Rainy Night House&rdquo; over the sound system. I am at peace. It&rsquo;s like a dream.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />Thirty days of mellow, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve found. My travel schedule came to an abrupt end when our family returned from Maui and I have jealously protected my opportunity to be home.  I&rsquo;ve been cooking (expanding my waist-line), spending time with the kids (brokering peace accords) and savoring life with my wife (doting on a beautiful woman and loving friend who still makes me giddy).<br /><br />And the family has been holding its breath. We&rsquo;re not ready to gasp for air &hellip; but we&rsquo;re definitely nervous to exhale. Jordan has returned to health. She has made so much progress in her battle against cancer that the doctors have rewarded her with a reduced chemotherapy schedule. Instead of every week, she now goes four weeks on and four weeks off. She&rsquo;s made such progress in her ability to walk that she now reports to physical therapy only once a week. Her last MRI showed that her condition is stable, and there is the slightest hint that the tumor may have reduced in size. She is proud, and we are proud of her.<br /><br />Fifteen days. She&rsquo;ll be eight years old in fifteen days. I find it so hard to believe that my little girl will be eight. And I am apprehensive. It was on her seventh birthday last year that she was unexpectedly admitted to CHLA due to complications from tumor growth. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever wipe that day from my memory, though I wish I could &ndash; she looked so small on the emergency room bed, screaming and fighting her broken body. She pleaded with me in agony to take her out of the hospital and &ldquo;get me out of this place, daddy!&rdquo;  I remember having to leave the room to sob in the lobby and curse God for what He was doing to my beautiful child.<br /><br />I wish I could say that it felt long ago, but it doesn&rsquo;t. And perhaps that&rsquo;s as it should be. We are filled with hope, but we sleep less sound. We are hardened in a sense to avoid letting cancer sucker punch us when we least expect it. We&rsquo;ve learned to enjoy days like this morning.<br /><br />So, we hold our breath. Fifteen days until another milestone. Eight years of joy from a child with verve and charm, strength and beauty, wisdom and tenacity. Thirty days of wellness and mellow for a family that sticks together remarkably well. Three years of a journey never planned, but revealing the best of those around us &ndash; how delicious, inspiring and fragile life can be.<br /><br />May it continue on.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-6247291308424782072?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She has an alter ego. Actually, she has several.<br /><br />She fluttered around the house a few days ago, wrapped in pink and purple scarves and various fashion tidbits never meant to co-exist. She had removed her splints (the molded plastic braces that help her walk and provide support to her ankles) and proceeded to skip across the floor. One of her scarves was dragging dangerously close to her feet so I advised caution.<br /><br />&ldquo;Jordan, you shouldn&rsquo;t be dancing without your splints. You might trip.&rdquo;<br /><br />She cast her eyes down, lifted her chin, cocked her head and elevated her voice to a very high, sweetened pitch.<br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not Jordan. I&rsquo;m Princess Arroya.&rdquo;<a name="more"></a><br /><br />She means to say Aurora, Sleeping Beauty, but she never quite gets it right. She continues to skip and dance, ignoring my advice. It is only one of her personalities.<br /><br />She was almost named Miranda &ndash; Miranda Ariel to be precise &ndash; but then we thought better of it. A bit too Disneyesque. But I often think it&rsquo;s who she is inside. She could easily play Shakespeare&rsquo;s castaway heroine doting dramatically on the young Ferdinand. She could also play another Miranda &ndash; the diabolical Miranda Priestly of the current feature film __The Devil Wears Prada__. When Jeanette and I saw the movie last week we pinched one another during certain scenes. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so Jordan,&rdquo; we&rsquo;d whisper as we watched Meryl Streep manipulate, intimidate and stylishly command the screen. It&rsquo;s all a part of her charm, her mystique, her presence. Half the time she&rsquo;s the giggling girl with wild eyes and rapid-fire stories. The other half is a coin toss.<br /><br />She looks fabulous (capital F). She&rsquo;s grown a bit, proudly catching up to her mother&rsquo;s chin, and she&rsquo;s put on some much-needed weight. Her cheeks blush forth on her slightly tanned and freckled skin. The eyes are alive again, always searching, always tempting; a virbrant window into whichever character she chooses to reveal. The characters surface through her imaginative repartee.<br /><br />Last week, during the unrelenting heat wave, Jordan was having trouble getting to sleep. It was just too hot. Jeanette suggested that she sleep in her skivvies. To which Jordan replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not that kind of girl.&rdquo;<br /><br />This afternoon I found her undressing at three. I asked what she was doing. Her answer: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going to &lsquo;hang&rsquo; in my pajamas.&rdquo;<br /><br />When we walked by the Tiffany store in Old Town Pasadena she advised me, &ldquo; you know what I always say, Dad. If it&rsquo;s not from Tiffany, send it back.&rdquo;<br /><br />And then there&rsquo;s my favorite story. During physical therapy a couple of months ago her therapists devised a game to keep her motivated. The male therapist pretended to be a devilish villain who had poisoned the female therapist. The female therapist lay down on the ground pretending to be very sick. Everyone cheered Jordan to walk to her and deliver the magic elixir that would help her awake. Jordan gave it a good go, struggling to walk half the distance. But then she tired out and turned around. Jeanette and the team called out, &ldquo;keep going Jordan, she needs the potion. You can save her!&rdquo; To which Jordan replied (without even turning to look back) &ldquo;Bye. I&rsquo;ll miss you.&rdquo;<br /><br />That&rsquo;s my girl &hellip; all of 'em.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-5258287596509542645?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The family returned Sunday from a fun and restful week in Maui. Jordan learned to hula, make a lei, and build a great sand castle. She mostly loved going in the pool with her family.<br /><br /><img alt="Jordan in Hawaii" src="http://jordanvincent.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/185744438_138baedfe3.jpg" /><br /><br />Luc shredded the waves again on a surf board, Nettie loved snorkeling out at Honoloa Bay, and I challenged myself to a 35 mile bike ride, climbing over 3,500 feet with an action advneture camp on the east side of the Island.<br /><br />Jordan needed the rest. This week she&rsquo;ll restart chemotherapy. She&rsquo;s also scheduled for an MRI. Keep your fingers crossed.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-9084873209312390177?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Perhaps going under the knife for two brain surgeries did it. I imagine that would make most anything seem pretty tame to me. Or perhaps it&rsquo;s a side effect of the chemotherapy. Or maybe it&rsquo;s just the girl she&rsquo;s become. Jordan loves a good adrenaline rush.<br /><br />That&rsquo;s right. She&rsquo;s a thrill-seeker. We know this because Thursday she tagged along with her brother and our friends James and Michael Muro to Universal Studios. She&rsquo;s tall enough to ride everything now, and ride she did &hellip; even when her brother chickened out. As you can imagine, she goads him about this constantly.<br /><br /><img alt="Jordan at Universal Studios" src="http://jordanvincent.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/100_3019_2.jpg" /><br /><br />Jurassic Park, The Mummy, Back to the Future &hellip; she rode them all. And she loved them. She can&rsquo;t stop talking about how fun they were. She&rsquo;s very proud that she didn&rsquo;t get scared. Quite the opposite, actually. She wants to go back and ride them again. Jeanette said the automatic ride photo from Jurassic Park perfectly captured Jordan&rsquo;s approach. As their boat tipped down to plummet four stories into a splash of water, everyone in the boat reeled back, wincing about what was to come. But not Jordan. She leans forward with a brilliant, toothy smile on her face.<br /><br />Enter Jordan the adventurer. She&rsquo;s my young Mame. She lives the phrase, &ldquo;life&rsquo;s a banquet and most poor suckers are starving.&rdquo;</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-8527716893760594530?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Pajama Girl</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She is on her third pair of pajamas for the day, leading me to think she is the spawn of Hugh Hefner. She seems to have pjs for every hour, every occasion and every mood-swing.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />She walks pidgeon-footed onto the patio, a crooked smile broadening onto a bright face. Each step is calculated, like the careful foot to foot of a tight-rope walker. The nerves are coming back in her legs, but her reflexes are still diminished. She stumbles about the house without her splints &ndash; a fact of pride and concern. The bruises on her legs demonstrate that walking is not yet second nature.<br /><br />&ldquo;How is your day, Dad?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better now, sweet pea.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; She gestures coyly, nodding her head down and to the side in a forced show of dramatic aplomb that would have made Joan Crawford blush.<br /><br />She drags a lawn chair towards me, careful to make the chairs touch at the armrests. Propping her feet up next to mine on the stone fire ring in our backyard, she settles back under the evening sky and makes small talk with me. Her phrases are buoyant, but matter-of-fact. Her train of thought ambles about in unpredictable directions, but her spirit remains the same.<br /><br />Sometimes, her wild mind drives us crazy. She&rsquo;s a chatter-box. The words spill from her mouth as fast as her mind can churn them out. In fact, I&rsquo;m convinced this is a coping mechanism. She has difficulty with short-term memory. I think she sometimes forgets what she wants to say mid-sentence. So she rushes to assemble her thoughts in words, leading to a littany of ideas; a stream of consciousness cast out as quickly as her mind can conjure it.<br /><br />Two weeks ago, she began at a new school &ndash; her third in two years. She likes it, especially the playground. What she most likes is the bus. When it arrived in front of our house earlier this week, she couldn&rsquo;t wait to saddle her backpack and ride the boxy yellow chariot. I watched her board the other day. She beamed with pride as she took her seat. And I stood and admired the resilience of the girl. She never stands down, never dwells maudlin. Life for her is stitched together with hopeful surprises and pleasant experience. She has learned to love the day, an example I am often reminded to recognize.<br /><br />Jeanette and I sometimes lose sight of this beautiful quality in our daughter. It is easy to overlook the girl in the patient when so much time is spent negotiating insurance claims, shuttling to outpatient therapies and balancing cancer treatment with the rigors of family life. But we are often reminded of Jordan&rsquo;s charm and character and tenacious, relentless power.<br /><br />Several weeks ago, during one of her visits to the hospital for chemo, she sat near to another patient who was having a bad day. The child threshed and screamed and fought the nurses with every gasping breath. He resisted the IV as though it was a venomous viper. The experience is not unusual. In fact, there have been visits when Jordan was every bit as resistant. But this day, she willingly assisted her caregivers. She told jokes and laughed and carried on conversation as though the gathering were a tea party. And the other parents looked on and wondered. They laughed with her and drew the attention away from their troubled kids to the chatty girl with the fresh pair of pajamas. And the mother of the threshing boy remarked, &ldquo;look at that little girl. See how she has fun.&rdquo;</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-5252094570764644409?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it was story time, she was the first to sit down on the floor in front of the teacher. She sat cross-legged, folding her hands in her lap. When the end of the storytelling neared, and her classmates fidgeted, attention waning, she sat with her hands still folded in her lap. Her eyes engaged the teller. Her brows shifted to project her connection with the the story. And when the last words were spoken, she was often the last one sitting, eager for another story.<br /><br /><img alt="Jordan Profile Age 7" src="http://jordanvincent.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/100_2812_2.JPG" /><br />Jordan takes time to pose at a recent family gathering. Her health continues to improve.<br /><br />She was four but had the attention span of one much older. She could be very focused, particularly in the context of competition. It was this focus that aided her in studies and caught the attention of local school admission directors. Like other children in Pasadena, Jordan endured the admissions process at all the leading private schools. Her scores on standard tests were exemplary. We knew we had a child with strong learning potential and an apt intellect.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />A video from a trip she and I took to Chicago provides a haunting glimpse at what she once could do. On a train ride, she chants a Halloween poem she learned in pre-school: __The Five Little Pumpkins__. She easily recalled all five verses and recited them with dramatic aplomb.<br /><br />Today, Jordan can hardly sit still for more than a minute. She struggles to remember familiar sayings. When she can&rsquo;t remember the exact words, she makes up her own. She tries to sing the Billy Holiday standard, __Them There Eyes__, a song she&rsquo;s known since infancy because I sang it to her all the time. The line, &ldquo;they sparkle, they bubble &hellip; they&rsquo;re going to get you in a lot of trouble&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;those blue eyes are going to get you in trouble.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s the best she can do even after a reminder of the actual lyric.<br /><br />And yet, sitting with her, it&rsquo;s hard not to imagine the possibility that remains within. Behind those restless eyes lies the same intelligent child. Her vocabulary is the clue to what&rsquo;s beneath. She effortlessly rattles off words like &ldquo;choreograph&rdquo;, &ldquo;frustrating&rdquo; and &ldquo;astonish&rdquo;. She is a studious observer, precisely identifying slight details about things she has encountered. Yet she struggles with words.<br /><br />So it is that we worry about Jordan&rsquo;s educational journey. After the onset of symptoms in 2004, she was dismissed from the private school where she was enrolled. We found a good public school that claimed to have excellent resources for children with learning disabilities. Though the transition to a new school was upsetting to her, Jordan adapted and bonded with her teachers. But we recently learned that the district wants to move her to another school with &ldquo;better resources.&rdquo;<br /><br />All of the schools have been sympathetic to Jordan&rsquo;s case.Â  Yet still I cannot help but feel betrayed. I know that my daughter is a light with much to offer the world. I don&rsquo;t understand why the educators cannot see it, too. They jump to the conclusion that she was always learning-challenged. But I have evidence this is not so &ndash; in test scores, in the accounts from her early school teachers, and in video.<br /><br />Most of all, I feel Jordan&rsquo;s frustration and believe that I would be depressed by the challenges she faces. Watching her in action is akin to watching an alzheimer&rsquo;s or dementia patient. You can tell that she knows what she wants to say, but her mind and mouth don&rsquo;t seem to cooperate. Her fingers don&rsquo;t allow her to write or draw what she clearly knows. She even struggles with coloring &ndash; trying over and over again to get the picture right until she usually resigns and moves on to something else.<br /><br />Jeanette and I try to keep all in perspective. The battle now is to beat cancer; ensure her physical longevity and then move on to other challenges. But I worry that we are wasting the opportunity to help our daughter grow intellectually. She is ready, in her own way. Perhaps I am in denial, but I believe that with the right teacher or educational support system, she can do much more. I think she wants to do much more. She wants to learn like her brother and her peers. She wants to read. She wants to prove to herself that she can shine, like she once did. And instead of getting help to get there, she gets shuffled off to another school.<br /><br />I believe that no generation is influenced by the safely predictable. Innovation and progress are driven by possibility and perseverance. Albert Einstein was considered a &ldquo;slow learner&rdquo;, and he may have been dyslexic. Who knows? Perhaps Jordan might one day rock the world of physics. She might choreograph a ballet, or write the great American novel, or create a new cure for cancer. She has the capacity for all these things. She has the capacity to change the world &hellip;  if only given a chance.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-1347130330803850120?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Call it the dramatic season end to a popular television show. A major plot point unfolds and just when you want to know what happens next &hellip; the credits roll and you have to wait four months to pick up with the story again.<br /><br />I know. That&rsquo;s what I did to you all.<br /><br />When we last left our heroine, she received news that her tumor was shrinking and she was given leave to return home from a lengthy hospital stay. Then the air went silent and the traffic spiked on the site with friends and family wanting to know &ldquo;then what?&rdquo;<a name="more"></a><br /><br />The short version of the story is simple: our family doesn&rsquo;t grasp the concept of incremental change. Everything with us, it seems, happens at once. The same day Jordan was discharged we moved into a new house. Then I hit the road with two weeks of business travel &hellip; oh, and Luc&rsquo;s baseball season began. It&rsquo;s crazy.<br /><br />Jordan is great. Not only is she walking more, her spirit is vivacious and strong. She&rsquo;s thrilled to be home. She loves having her own room. And she takes great pride in her recent accomplishments. In fact, this week she managed her chemotherapy dose without any fuss &ndash; a significant feat. Normally, we have to hold her down to access her port. It isn&rsquo;t the pain, it&rsquo;s the associated anxiety she&rsquo;s developed. But working with a child life specialist at CHLA, she found a way to conquer her fear. She called me while I was in New York to say, &ldquo;Dad, I did EXCELLENT today when they came to take my blood.&rdquo;<br /><br />So while our family may be a bit stressed out, and we may be hard to reach, we are actually doing quite well. And a new season of episodes on Jordan&rsquo;s Journey will unfold soon on a webscreen near you.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-8342550862412538775?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;You have to relax or you&rsquo;ll never get this.&rdquo;<br /><br />I nod, forcing a smile as best I can, my lips stretched across my tightly-clenched jaw. My lungs burn as I kneel forward onto my hands. My calves spasm, reminding me that about a year has passed since I last exercised.<br /><br /><img src="http://jordanvincent.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/lv_snow_success.jpg" alt="Larry Snowboards" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-88" /><br />The author takes time from falling to pose for a portrait.<br /><br />I look up to see Dean, my snowboarding instructor, stepping out of his bindings and walking towards me. He is the most patient man in Aspen. The rest of my group waits for me at the base. But I am only halfway, and I&rsquo;ve lost count of how many times I&rsquo;ve wiped out. <a name="more"></a><br /><br />A pair of gloved hands outstretch to help me up. I struggle to balance myself as Dean provides a quick pep talk. The trick, he says, is to relax my body and allow the board to pick up some speed. He asks me to try closing my eyes this time and use my head to lead the board. When he advises me to open my eyes, I am accelerating down hill, my balance perfect.<br /><br />&ldquo;Now, Larry, shift onto your toes!&rdquo;<br /><br />The nose of my board points straight down now and I gain speed. The feeling is exhilirating and terrifying all at once. I hesitate to shift my weight while Dean calmly reminds me again to &ldquo;get up&rdquo; on my toe side. Miraculously, I do, and my board slows and veers to the left. Dean calls for me to shift the weight back again and look straight down the mountain. I do, and the speed returns.<br /><br />My heart is racing now. I&rsquo;m snowboarding! But I convince myself I&rsquo;m out of control. My head calculates how to crash. Dean counsels me to look to my right and rock back on my heels. The proposed weight shift is to my strongest side &ndash; my heel edge. It should be a breeze, but my head is over-thinking and I pull back too harshly, plant my board and twist into the snow.<br /><br />I breathe ferociously, goggles clouded from my panting and perspiring. My body wants to remain still. I&rsquo;m exhausted and think myself foolish for even trying. And just as I am about to strap out of the board and take the easy way out, I hear a voice from above.<br /><br />&ldquo;Hi, Dad. Nice wipeout!&rdquo;<br /><br />Lucas chuckles respectfully as he passes over on the chair lift. As he ambles away, I hear a final command from over his shoulder, &ldquo;keep it up!&rdquo;<br /><br />The scene was Aspen, Colorado. Lucas and I traveled there last week for a father-son bonding experience. We usually try to get away once a year and this year we elected to learn snowboarding. I broke my arm on last year&rsquo;s adventure, learning to skateboard. I figured snowboarding was a natural next step.<br /><br />We had a great time, and I eventually got the hang of it. One more day and I would have either (a) mastered the basics or (b) blown out a knee.<br /><br />While we were away Jordan continued to progress on her own. Her rehabilitation is going marvelously well. In fact, she will be discharged from the hospital this Friday. Her legs are gaining strength. She moves around with a walker and can stand on her own for longer periods of time. She still has a long way to go. She will continue outpatient physical therapy several times a week and requires specially-designed casts to support her knees and joints. Nevertheless, she&rsquo;s made rapid progress that even surprised her physicians.<br /><br />There is more good news. Though not official, the latest MRI scan indicates the tumor may have slightly decreased in size. While the mass of the tumor is still daunting, it is marginally less daunting today. In our family, that&rsquo;s cause for celebration.<br /><br />Of course, I didn&rsquo;t know any of this as I lay in the snow last week, contemplating surrender. But as I hoisted my pathetic body back onto the board and groaned from the stiffness of my legs, I thought about Jordan. I wondered if she would snowboard down the mountain with us one day. I wondered if my trivial age and condition-related pain was any benchmark for the certain aching she must feel each time she re-learns to walk. And I thought about the magical way she goes about recovery &ndash; with stamina, and strength, and color. The kid hasn&rsquo;t given up. She&rsquo;s done exactly what was required of her and more. She&rsquo;s faced challenges most of us would shrink from, stared down adversity with tenacity, and managed to find plenty of extra time to relax in the hospital play room or joke with her family. No matter how tough the cancer and the chemo gets, she gets tougher.<br /><br />And with those thoughts circling in my head, I quit my moaning, lifted my sorry rear-end off the ground, and boarded the rest of the way down the mountain without falling once. As I turned to a stop at the base, Dean looked over and flashed a smile. &ldquo;Now, you&rsquo;re doing it.&rdquo;<br /><br />And so is she.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-949910829239212843?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jeanette and I escaped for most of the weekend. We checked in to a hotel and did absolutely nothing &ndash; other than lounge around the pool deck, read magazines and sip cool cocktails.<br /><br />Jordan got an escape of her own. She spent the night at her grandparents and partied in their hot tub. Grandma did a good job of pampering her. She was smiling wildly by the time I saw her Sunday afternoon. That&rsquo;s when our family got together for a Sunday dinner before Jordan had to check back in at CHLA. Our feast offered more nourishment than food alone.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />I went Martha Stewart. I prepared a full spread for our little family. There was hardly room on the table for all the dishes: onion soup, roast pork, fresh green beans and roasted potatoes &ndash; and toffee cake for dessert. There were candles, jazz music and two loads of dishes to do. I spared no labor to make Jordan&rsquo;s brief family meal at home big and memorable. And it was.<br /><br />Jordan greeted me at the elevator with a big statement:<br /><br />&ndash;I&rsquo;m so happy to be home with my family.<br /><br />Nettie and I connected eyes, each of us thinking about the obvious. Jordan was only going to be home for a few hours. But Jordan knew this. And she didn&rsquo;t dwell on it. She wanted to savor the experience and she wasn&rsquo;t shy about sharing her enthusiasm for precious family time.<br /><br />Gathered round the table, the kids bounced jokes off one another. Each competed for the loudest volume until Nettie or I reminded them that we were all sitting close together&ndash;close enough to hear soft voices. Just as the conversation crescendoed, and our spoons aimed for the soup bowls, Jordan reprimanded us. We had to say grace.<br /><br />Lucas volunteered to do the honors. He offered thanks succinctly but honestly. Then he reached for his spoon. Not before Jordan asked to say a prayer of her own. Her eyes tendered solemnity. She folded her hands and bowed her head.<br /><br />&ndash;God, thank you for my family and thank you for helping me kick cancer&rsquo;s butt. And &hellip; thank you for letting me come home.<br /><br />Then, just as quickly as she transfixed us with her humility and hope, she switched gears and giggled out loud. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s eat!&rdquo; A spoonfull of soup disappeared down her throat, followed by enthusiastic praise.<br /><br />&ndash;Good soup, Dad!<br /><br />For a little over an hour we forgot about hospitals and therapies. We were a family gathered around, doing something we didn&rsquo;t do all that often when Jordan was at the peak of health. In fact, our family perfected the art of dinner via snacks. But on this Sunday we were a Rockwellian portrait of family dinner. And it felt great.<br /><br />When it was time for Jordan to leave. The farewell was brief. She has developed a curious and disconcerting habit. You are allowed to say goodbye. She expects a warm hug and sometimes a kiss. But then, she is done. It&rsquo;s as though you&rsquo;ve left the room. Once she&rsquo;s said goodbye, she ceases eye contact. No matter how hard you try to get her attention, she ignores you. On one occasion, when Jeanette insisted on getting Jordan&rsquo;s attention out of fear something was wrong, Jordan reprimanded her mother.<br /><br />&ndash;Mom, I&rsquo;m through with you.<br /><br />So, Sunday night, after a giant embrace I strapped her into the minivan and bid her goodnight. She looked away and told me she would see me tomorrow. I blew her a kiss that she summarily ignored, and watched as my two girls left to return to CHLA. But rather than feel sad and helpless, I lingered in the warm glow of a family healing process.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-8410036173463907848?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m not going to lie to you. Lately I&rsquo;ve had a lot of anger issues. It&rsquo;s not that I run around screaming at people or bashing walls with blunt objects. It&rsquo;s a slow, teeming displeasure that errupts in outbursts of visible frustration.<br /><br />The crux of the problem, the god particle of the issue, the kernel that explodes every time is resentment about the unfairness of it all. It isn&rsquo;t how unfair it is to me, nor the imposition of illness. It&rsquo;s the toll that it is taking on my daughter. This toll is always made evident when my screensaver springs to life on my idling laptop. There they are &ndash; the pictures of Jordan at the height of wellness, her cheeks blushing with baby fat and her smile eviscerating any hint of abnormality.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />My photo library is classified into two groups: those pictures taken before diagnosis, and those after. I see pictures from a trip we took together to Chicago and I think, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s before she got sick&rdquo;. Then I view pictures from our trip to Hawaii and I think, &ldquo;the disease was growing here&rdquo;.<br /><br />And thus starts the rage. It is here that I begin to argue how promising her future was, how she excelled at her studies, competed with physical stamina, and courted with obstinate charm. It is here that I complain about unfairness. It is here that I wail about the snail&rsquo;s pace of resolution. It is in this intemperate, resentful space that I burst open like a shaken can of pop on a hot, humid day. It is here that I ask: why her and not me?<br /><br />The anger surfaces unevenly. When things are very bad, it often recedes. Perhaps my mind has a shock system that allows me to filter out the really bad feelings when the situation calls for me to be upbeat and positive. Perhaps it is this very act of repression that makes the resurfacing all the more pungent and unexpected. Lately, I feel it a lot, and yet Jordan is agruably doing well. She is speaking with greater clarity. Her physical therapy is going well. Her body is handling the chemo without obvious side effects.<br /><br />But sitting in the hospital with her for thirty minutes conjures gnawing indignation. Hospitals are horrible places. It is an irony that they are associated with healing. Everyone in them is sick. Ill emotional radiation swirls around the patients, seeps through the impermeable, antiseptic walls and saps hope from all around. It is hard not to be angry in a hospital.<br /><br />Jordan feels it, too. Each passing day invites new irritability. Her emotions change rapidly. One moment she is giddy and playful. The next she is cross and vexes bystanders with hysterical trivialities. We shimmy back and forth on a volatile path of emotional highs and lows. The net effect is fatigue.<br /><br />Jordan has a friend at CHLA, whom she met awhile ago on a retreat for pediatric brain tumor patients and their families. Her friend was re-admitted last week to begin an aggressive treatment. The drugs she will take have horrible, painful side-effects. In her case, there is no other course of action. Her cancer is pressing and extremely dangerous. Hearing of this made me realize that Jordan is lucky, in spite of the anger and impatience we all feel. Her cancer is methodical but lazy. She is not fighting for her life, she is fighting to be &ldquo;normal&rdquo; again. Despite the drama that daily unfolds, I must remind myself to keep my composure. Flush the bad feelings as circumstances allow. And hope for the day when I can see a photo and think, &ldquo;this was after she beat cancer&rdquo;.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-8619395350861079372?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Jordan rested well over the weekend. She’s moving around the house skillfully and finding new and inventive ways to occupy her time. She wanted to clean all day Sunday. It was an obsession. I can’t say there was any joy in it. It seems to be more of a compulsion than a way to pass the time. I think she wants to prove to herself what she can still do.

I haven’t written much in recent days. Ordinarily, writing helps me process and purge. Throughout Jordan’s illness, writing offered a refuge. But in the these last few days, words are hard to muster. I am desensitized–numb. I think we all are. We are relieved that Jordan is home and that she is awake again. But it doesn’t really feel like she’s completely back. A part of her is missing. Smiles are hard to coax from her. Her words are all a jumble. Sometimes, what she says is completely nonsensical, but what she means is perfectly sane. She told me I was the “oldest birthday in my family.” What she meant was that I was the only brother. When she said this, her face revealed her frustration. She doesn’t let it stop her, though. And that is something to celebrate.

We are grateful to our many friends. So many of you have wanted to help and have proffered prayers and well-wishes. Our family has been very guarded in these recent days. We’ve placed ourselves in isolation. I’m not sure why we’ve chosen to handle our grief and our anxiety this way this time. We feel blessed by the love and support around us, even if we haven’t been the most accessible. Thank you.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever since her very first hospital stay, Jordan has reacted well to pet therapies. Specially trained dogs visit the hospital nearly every day. Their sole purpose: bring a little joy to sick kids. In Jordan&rsquo;s case, the effect is startling, as these three pictures reveal.<br /><br />The first picture is from her second day in the hospital, when she was in a continuous state of unconsciousness. Notice that she tries to open her eyes for the picture. Her hand was not placed. She reached out for the dog just before the camera caught the picture.<br /><img style="clear:left;float:none;padding-top:10px;" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3012/2813319800_d742329522.jpg?v=0" alt="Jordan &amp; Dog Day 1" /><br />The second picture is taken a couple of days later. Jordan was unconscious most of the time, and beginning to have very serious seizures. Just before this picture with Moses was taken, she bolted to a sitting position. You can see Jeanette rushing in to stabilize her.<br /><img style="clear:left;float:none;padding-top:10px;" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3218/2812471671_2212885331.jpg?v=0" alt="Jordan &amp; Dog Day 2" /><br />The last picture was taken a few days ago. Though difficult to make out in the photo, Jordan smiled at the dog.<br /><img style="clear:left;float:none;padding-top:10px;" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3171/2812471761_c479b13612.jpg?v=0" alt="Jordan &amp; Dog Day 3" /></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-6762833509818018461?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She&rsquo;s trying to do too much too fast. Her body isn&rsquo;t keeping up and it&rsquo;s making her sad. We experienced a night like this once before. I think the expectation of coming home rarely lives up to what she imagines. But we are happy to have her back. Luc is trying very hard to do things for her. He&rsquo;s a bit clumsy, which frustrates him. But how wonderful he is to pamper her so!</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-44084410434506822?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&rsquo;s a great quote attributed to the actor Laurence Olivier:<br /></p><blockquote>There is a spirit in us &ndash; that makes our brass to blare and our cymbals crash &ndash; all, of course, supported by the practicalities of trained lung power, throat, heart, guts.</blockquote><br /><br />There can be no doubt that Jordan possesses all four of Olivier&rsquo;s practicalities. And she has no shortage of spirit. Be it cross, determined, ornery, charming or doleful, she generously shares her pains and pleasures with those in her presence. She is not easily subdued. The tumors try, but the odds are against them.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />That spirit was on display today. When I arrived, the first words out of her mouth were &ldquo;I want to go home.&rdquo; It was not like yesterday. Yesterday, I had to scramble the sounds coming out of her mouth. I had to interpret noises and piece them together into the phrase. Today, there was no mistaking it. I tried to reason with her, but she interrupted me, grabbed my sleeve and said shortly, &ldquo;come on. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; It was followed by a good twenty minutes of arguing. She just kept saying, &ldquo;I want to go home.&rdquo; We just kept saying, &ldquo;you will &hellip; but not today.&rdquo;<br /><br />She&rsquo;s making progress. With assistance, she can now walk to the bathroom. She can sit up for short periods of time. She even made a trip to the play room. But she runs out of gas fast, and I think when she does she faces the reality that she&rsquo;s not well enough to sleep in her own bed. That depresses her &ndash; just for a short while. Then she brandishes the &ldquo;damn the torpedoes&rdquo; mentality and we have our hands full.<br /><br />Despite her improved surface appearance, she isn&rsquo;t out of the woods yet. The diagnosis lacks definition. Even the doctors have to admit that we are in uncharted waters. We don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s causing her symptoms. We don&rsquo;t know how likely she is to relapse. And we don&rsquo;t know how much of the residual effects are permanent or temporary? She will have another test tomorrow. And unfortunately, she is likely to remain in the hospital for awhile.<br /><br />Before I left for the night, she had dosed off after puttering around the room for a bit. Just as I was preparing to leave, she opened her eyes and peered over at me. These were not the eyes of an eight year old. They held a premature maturity; a knowingness that was at once captivating and unsettling. I tried to break the spell by whispering over to her. But she didn&rsquo;t fall for it. She looked at me with such an intensity for half a second I wondered if she was having an absent seizure &ndash; when she fades away for a moment but locks her eyes in place. But no sooner did I think this than she remarked, &ldquo;take me with you.&rdquo; It was her one moment of fragility in an otherwise stoic day. I explained it wasn&rsquo;t possible and as quickly as she shed her armor it was back on again. She dimissed me &hellip; allowed me to kiss her a few times on the forehead &hellip; but sent me on my way without much notice.<br /><br />If anyone is suited to the rigors of a rare disease, surely it is she. Hope is the strategy we must follow. We&rsquo;ve been told to put our faith in science, God and miracles. I&rsquo;ve put my faith in the girl. Hope flows through her diatribes and defiance. Hope is the muddy Irish pumping through her veins and the dominant woman forced to emerge in the pretty girl. I have faith in her.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-2467904209069221219?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The test went well. She was actually awake during most of it and she was very cooperative. It took a long time. We have no new information, other than the pressure was not elevated. That pretty much rules out a shunt malfunction.<br /><br />She&rsquo;s much more talkative. She keeps saying she wants to go home. I think she keeps asking so that one time we&rsquo;ll slip and say, &ldquo;okay.&rdquo; She doesn&rsquo;t look sad as much as she looks cross and determined. We love it. Her fighting spirit is in full force. If she keeps up at this pace, she may get her wish very soon. But there are still mountains to climb. She&rsquo;s eating through a tube, speaking sloppily, and barely able to use her right arm. We just keep encouraging her to &ldquo;get mad at it&rdquo; and &ldquo;show her tough stuff.&rdquo; She will.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-2411370548058610223?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://jordanvincent.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/smile.jpg" alt="Jordan Smile" /><br /><strong>In a photo taken earlier this year, Jordan demonstrates the &ldquo;million dollar smile&rdquo; .</strong><br />It was as if someone fired a flash bulb. The room lit up when the smile erupted on her face; the toothy smile that&rsquo;s become part of her beauty and charm. The smile that IS Jordan. It was partially obscured as she lay sideways on her pillow, but its potency was unabated. That smile pumped oxygen into the room and provided her family a chance to breathe in hope. And the triggering event was the appearance of her brother. She even tried to say his name. It came out as a long vowelled sound, but there was no mistaking what it meant.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />Luc can be guarded with his emotions. On matters relating to his sister&rsquo;s health, the defenses are more extreme. He is reticent to discuss her condition, and when he does he is always careful to have another activity to distract himself.<br /><br />In the past, we&rsquo;ve been quick to brief Luc on Jordan&rsquo;s progress. This time, things happened too fast, answers were scarce, and neither of us had the emotional fuel to broach the subject. Finally, a few nights ago, we decided it couldn&rsquo;t be put off any longer. As I sat in his room going over what we knew, he continued playing his guitar, being careful not to make eye contact with me. I asked him a couple of times to stop playing, which he would do momentarily. But as soon as I began talking about the hospital or her seizures or anything that he found uncomfortable, he&rsquo;d return to his picking. The most verbal response I could muster from him was a &ldquo;yeah&rdquo; or an &ldquo;okay.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s been this way all week.<br /><br />Yesterday, when Jordan&rsquo;s condition deteriorated so steeply, I knew I had to level with him. He needed to let it out, or at least let it sink in. And, he needed to pay her a visit. For one, seeing her might make what he imagined less daunting. But there was more to it than that. Jordan&rsquo;s seizure yesterday was potentially life-threatening. For the first time during her journey, we now have to consider the possibility that she might &ldquo;code&rdquo;. We felt Luc needed to spend time with her to reconnect so that there were no regrets if her condition worsened. And, of course, we believed his visit might lift her spirits &hellip; and it did.<br /><br />I cornered him on our way out the door yesterday. I can&rsquo;t say it was my smoothest performance. I told him Jordan was in bad shape and he needed to go and be with her. At first, he tried to deflect and refocus on another subject. But he received tough love from me. The gravity hit him hard. He wrapped his arms around my waist and let it all out, sobbing and clinging to me with force. After several minutes, I sat him down, fetched a cold washcloth for his eyes and gave him time to adjust. He was silent for a bit, then he said, &ldquo;Dad, she&rsquo;s going to be ok. She always gotten better before. You know she&rsquo;s tough.&rdquo;<br /><br />He didn&rsquo;t say these words with question marks. There was no sign of him looking to me to reassure him. This was him turning my attention to a point of fact. And just like that, Luc helped me tap a well of faith I was beginning to think was running dry.<br /><br />We agreed that he would go and see her with me today.<br /><br />Luc hates the hospital. He hates anything that has to do with the body or medicine or biology. His anxiety was palpable the minute we turned left and entered the hospital parking lot, although he played at being upbeat. As we walked the winding corridors to her room, he made small talk while his eyes searched for signs of distress. But when we got to her room, he entered ahead of me with firm resolve.<br /><br />Jordan didn&rsquo;t notice him right away. She was awake after a long night of restful sleep. Her strength is coming back. She tries to talk quite a bit, but it&rsquo;s very difficult to understand her. She is starting to move her right arm some, although it is very weak. She attempts to sit up at times but tires very quickly and wants to lie down again.<br /><br />I walked up to her bed and pretended to climb over the rail. I told her I had a message from one of her cats. Then I pushed my head into her side like he always does. This provoked a mild grin. And then I told her I brought somebody along with me. That&rsquo;s when she saw Lucas. And that&rsquo;s when the million dollar smile surfaced.<br /><br />Luc was great with her. He reminisced about some of their favorite television shows, acting out scenes they both found funny. She loved it. After a few minutes, her energy subsided. Her eyes sometimes roll up until she wills them back into focus. Luc took this as a cue and settled down in a chair near her bed. Jeanette hadn&rsquo;t eaten and needed some basic supplies, so she and Luc went down to the market while I stayed with Jordan. I crawled into bed with her and snuggled. She grabbed my free arm and draped it over her. After a few minutes I heard her mumbling but I couldn&rsquo;t make out what she was saying. I moved my ear closer to her mouth and barely made out the words. They came in a half-whisper.<br /><br />&ldquo;I want my own bed.&rdquo;<br /><br />I reassured her that she would get back to her own bed soon, but she needed to get better first. She looked away from me.<br /><br />The attending oncologist paid her a visit while we snuggled. He was impressed by the progress she has made in 24 hours. Yesterday, he was &ldquo;concerned&quot; about her condition and challenged us to consider what our plan would be if the next seizure led to respiratory failure. Today, when he saw the change in her, her attempts at speech, the strength in her arms, her movement, he described it simply as &quot;awesome.&rdquo; He repeated this characterization as he passed Jeanette and Luc in the hall.<br /><br />We visited for a few hours and then it was time for Luc and I to go. Luc gave her a kiss (rare, indeed) and allowed his mom to dole out a massive hug. I smothered Jordan in kisses and ribbed her about giving the nurses such a hard time. She keeps removing her pulse/ox sensor and tries to take off the heart monitor leads whenever she can. The nurses reposition everything when they come to take her vitals, but in the interim she removes them again. She gave me a sly grin.<br /><br />Then I leaned in and quoted a line from one of her favorite books. I said, &ldquo;I love you all the way to the moon.&quot; She smiled again and tried to speak. The words were unintelligible, but I knew exactly what she said.<br /><br />&quot;I love you to the moon &ndash; and back.&quot;</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-1262704481594646157?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Her seizure this morning lasted for nearly an hour and took several rounds of drugs to end. For the first time, it affected her breathing, though she responded well to oxygen. She&rsquo;s asleep nearly all the time, largely because of the dose of anti-convulsants coursing through her body.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was a draining day Friday. It began with a massive seizure, but ended with everyone resting as best they could. Jordan spent most of the day asleep, much of which was induced by anesthesia. A powerful sedative ended the morning seizure. Then later in the day she was put under general anesthesia so radiology could do another MRI and MRA scan.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />We had a lengthy chat with her neuro-oncologist. I&rsquo;ve written of him before. He&rsquo;s an inspiration to our family and a generous mentor. He explained the team&rsquo;s current thinking about Jordan&rsquo;s case, and he wasn&rsquo;t shy about saying that there really aren&rsquo;t any concrete answers at this point. Stroke is one of the hypotheses, although it is an unlikely one because there are no signs of it in the scans. The new scans she had yesterday afternoon went looking specifically for evidence of stroke and they came back clean.<br /><br />The other hypothesis is that these symptoms are as a result of the tumor&rsquo;s retreat. The team hypothesizes that scar tissue left behind on the brain lining might be triggering the seizures, paralysis and lapses of consciousness. And yet another hypothesis is that the tumor itself is the culprit. Even though it is getting smaller, the reduction is relative. Jordan has a massive amount of disease on her brain. While it may not have caused these symptoms in the past, a top-level view of her MRI shows that the tumor is present in the affected areas of the brain.<br /><br />As for the paralysis, it may be a condition known as Todd&rsquo;s paralysis, named after a 19th century Scottish doctor who discovered that some of his seizure patients developed partial paralysis that dissipated shortly thereafter. If the case, Jordan should regain the use of her right arm. For now, she can&rsquo;t move it or grasp anything with it.<br /><br />Seeing her go under again for the MRI was unusually hard on me. It doesn&rsquo;t cause any pain, but her eyes look so afraid. She can&rsquo;t speak, but she doesn&rsquo;t have to. She looks at me &ndash; seems to look into me &ndash; and imparts all her fear and resignation. She&rsquo;s making do as best she can. Actually, she&rsquo;s making do better than most of us. Her strength is superhuman. But it&rsquo;s very hard to watch her lie still in her hospital bed with those quiet eyes. It&rsquo;s a stark contrast to who she normally is.<br /><br />She&rsquo;s done with tests for now. Last night they were finally able to start feeding her through the ng stube. When Jeanette asked if her tummy was starting to feel better she nodded. We hope that nourishment will give her strength to bounce back some more. We hope that rest and the weekend will restore her to better health.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-1174641961480673040?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is progress to report. Jordan was conscious for longer periods of time today. She has been able to respond to yes or no questions by nodding, but she&rsquo;s still unable to speak. Her eyes were much more alive. She even watched television for awhile and helped us choose a channel for her by nodding when she found one she liked.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />When I arrived, she was soundly asleep. While Nettie and I were visiting and catching up on the latest conversations with the medical crew, Jordan opened her eyes and looked over at me. I held her hand and complimented her on how fabulous she looked. Later, I asked her if she wanted to snuggle and she nodded yes. It was a bit of a challenge to the laws of physics for me to find space on the bed, but once I did, she rested her head on my shoulder. I reminded her of some of her favorite episodes of Zack and Cody and I actually got her to giggle. She tried to tell me something but all that came out were a jumble of sounds. I could tell this frustrated her, but it didn&rsquo;t spoil the moment.<br /><br />She cannot swallow much, so she now has a feeding tube, which she tolerates. Her right side is not fully responsive. She can&rsquo;t use her right arm, and she&rsquo;s aware of this, though she&rsquo;s coping with it well. She&rsquo;s tired and lacks energy, partly because she has not had any food since Monday. This was partly due to treatment, partly due to being unconcscious, and partly due to uncoordination by the hospital. She should have received some nourishment through the tube this evening.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the day did not end well. Around 8pm she had a significant seizure that  lasted for nearly four minutes. It was not as violent as the seizures she had a year ago, but it was more pronounced than the ones she had a few days ago. She&rsquo;s been given some extra meds and is under close watch. When last I connected with Nettie, Jordan was resting comfortably again. We&rsquo;ve asked for a consult with the team tomorrow.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-2421538553398088611?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>without the mercy of<br />your eyes your<br />voice your<br />ways(o very most my shinning love)<br /><br />how more than dark i am,<br />no song(no<br />thing)no<br />silence ever told;it has no name&ndash;<br /><br /><em>e.e. cummings</em><br /><br />There is a nurse at CHLA who has known Jordan for several years now. Her name is Barbara, and she is one of those beautiful souls who give and give and give to their patients, to the point that you wonder when/if they have a life of their own. We love Barbara. She provides great guidance, loving care and apt tactical support, wrangling doctors and specialists. It was no surprise to us that she was the first to arrive on the scene this morning after we put out a plea for advice.<br /><br />Barbara stood next to Jordan&rsquo;s bed with us, admiring her and wondering where to go from here. Together, we discussed the conflicting opinions of the doctors and tried to take stock of the challenge. Finally, it was Barbara who made the most sense out of what we were trying to understand. She said, &ldquo;Jordan never does anything conventionally. She&rsquo;s giving us a unique challenge. The trouble is, even when she&rsquo;s not well she lulls us into believing she is healthy.&rdquo;<a name="more"></a><br /><br />She&rsquo;s exactly right on both counts. Jordan is never conventional. Why should her illness break the mold? And we are so accustomed to her strength, vitality and ebullient charisma that the warning signs of illness are often overshadowed. We are lulled by her personality, which for the moment is absent without leave.<br /><br />While there has been progress in the last 24 hours, there is no real diagnosis. She made some visual responses today. When one doctor asked her to wave, she cautiously raised her left hand. She could not raise the right. But at least she responded.<br /><br />It&rsquo;s difficult to celebrate the progress because she seems far, far away. Though I realize this will sound harsh, the body in the hospital bed is more a zombie than it is Jordan. We can&rsquo;t help feeling that she&rsquo;s trying to break free&ndash;she&rsquo;s trying to push the body snatcher away&ndash;but she can&rsquo;t. There is a look of resignation in her eyes, the same look you may have seen in Alzheimer&rsquo;s or stroke patients. It is a look of suppression. It is a look of wanting, a sense that underneath the surface they are screaming to you, but the body won&rsquo;t let it out. It is heartbreaking.<br /><br />While she sleeps, we are lulled. We look over to see her resting and we take comfort. When they try to examine her, we are amused by her stubborn resistance, her repeated attempts to pull the covers back over her body. That&rsquo;s her strength. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve come to love and respect. But then she wakes. And the saddness of her eyes breaks us from our false sense of confidence.<br /><br />Of particular concern is the length of her absence. She&rsquo;s never had these symptoms for this long before. We keep waiting for her to turn a corner (and we sense that she keeps trying to turn that corner) but it hasn&rsquo;t come. We hope she&rsquo;s merely traversing an abnormally long city block and that she&rsquo;ll head back once the skyscrapers clear.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-6431164935165181364?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An update: neurosurgery attempted to &ldquo;tap&rdquo; Jordan&rsquo;s shunt today, in order to rule out a blockage. To tap it means to try and draw spinal fluid from a needle inserted into a well at the base of the shunt in her head (it sounds more painful than it is). The neurosurgeon was unable to draw any fluid, so the new theory is that her shunt is malfunctioning and requires a &ldquo;revision&rdquo; &ndash; surgery to repair or replace it.<br /><br />We&rsquo;re pushing back on the docs to ensure that this is a consensus opinion. If it is, Jordan will undergo surgery tomorrow morning. I will post more when I have more information.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-8137273036019203252?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we walked the corridors of CHLA, we were greeted by a couple of nurses and technicians. Jeanette and I said hello and stepped into the elevator on our way to the cafeteria while Jordan underwent an MRI.<br /><br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really sad that we recognize all these people,&rdquo; I said.<br /><br />&ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s sad that they recognize us,&rdquo; Jeanette replied.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />She is right. We are back at CHLA and it&rsquo;s all become too familiar. What&rsquo;s different is the lack of instigating circumstances. No falls. No surgeries. No significant changes in Jordan&rsquo;s pathology. But she&rsquo;s out. There has been no progress in her condition. She&rsquo;s still unconcscious, only occasionally opening her eyes. When she does so her eyes are fully dilated, feral and bereft. It&rsquo;s as if she isn&rsquo;t really there. She sleeps until a wild impulse overtakes her, so wild that the nurses have taped pillows to the sides of the bed. They keep a close watch on her. Last night she stood up in the middle of the night and tried to walk across the room. She wasn&rsquo;t awake.<br /><br />We are on a quest for answers. They are in short supply. Thus far the tests are inconclusive. The tumor appears stable. Her vitals normal. All we have now is a theory: Jordan may be having strokes.<br /><br />Do you remember the scene from Jaws where Roy Scheider first realizes what&rsquo;s going on when the shark attacks on Independence Day? Steven Spielberg used a cinematic technique pioneered by Hitchcock, called a reverse tracking shot. The camera dollies away very quickly while the camera operator zooms in with the lens. It creates an effect where the depth of field changes rapidly creating a feeling of isolated dizziness. That&rsquo;s how we felt today when we first heard the word &ldquo;stroke.&rdquo;<br /><br />Jeanette asked the obvious question. Is it common for a child to have a stroke? The doctor&rsquo;s answer held little comfort: no, but it&rsquo;s also not common for a child to have this much disease in the brain.<br /><br />&ldquo;This much disease in the brain.&rdquo; We heard this phrase before, by another doctor. Those words strung together about your child are like someone punching you hard in the belly. You can&rsquo;t breathe for a minute. You don&rsquo;t know how to respond. You know it&rsquo;s true. It&rsquo;s not new information. But it stuns nonetheless, kind of like the words &ldquo;malignant brain tumor&rdquo; and &ldquo;cancer.&rdquo; Add &ldquo;stroke&rdquo; to the list.<br /><br />And it makes sense: the partial paralysis on one side of the body, memory loss, agitation, drooping of the face, loss of consciousness. How could we not have considered this before? Maybe because she&rsquo;s eight.<br /><br />Jeanette and I don&rsquo;t know how to feel. My mind has been racing since yesterday morning when I first learned Jordan had relapsed. I am restless and confused and uncertain about where to let my mind wander. Jeanette describes a similar emotional state. Cancer has a certain gravity that can be assuaged by countless success stories. Even though Jordan&rsquo;s cancer is rare, we took comfort in its pace and lack of aggression. A stroke is a different matter, made ominous by the lack of treatment options.<br /><br />That said, we don&rsquo;t know for sure that Jordan is having strokes. It is a theory &ndash; a theory that sadly makes sense, but is unproven. In a couple of days the doctors will order another CT scan. They will compare the results to the scan from yesterday. Ordinarily, evidence of a stroke can be seen on the film after a couple of days. Until then, we wait. We sing to her. We rest a hand on her back and brush the hair from her face. We talk about other subjects and manage the things that can&rsquo;t be ignored. And we wait.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-5369743159157759161?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Force of Will</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am fascinated by biographies of famous leaders and public figures. I have little interest in the tawdry details of their sex lives. What I’ve always found interesting is how significant events in their early lives shape the nuances and strengths of their adult careers. Thus Teddy Roosevelt’s childhood asthma led to his robust interest in physical fitness. His doctor-prescribed retreats west fueled his later passion for the American frontier (he was sent to Arizona to dry out his lungs). Both shaped his presidency. One influenced his heroic efforts in the Spanish American War, the other gave birth to the national park system.

It is through this “life lens” that I often reflect on my own children. How will Jordan’s journey with cancer shape the woman she will become? How will it affect Luc? Sometimes I believe the answers to both questions permeate our daily family life.<a name="more"></a>

Jordan’s trajectory is unrestrained. Cancer is forging a dominating presence within the shell of an effusive, charismatic, eccentric personality. She plays at lady-like fragility, but there is little trace of weakness. The seaworthiness of modern ships is a function of the quality of the welds that hold the steel together. Jordan’s mental welds are impregnable.

I had come home from a long day at work, spent and ready for a drink. I had not even set down my keys when Jordan sprung from the hallway into our living room calling my name. She hung from my waist by her arms and began a litany of recollections from the day’s activity. She wanted to snuggle and read a book together. I begged for down time and turned toward the kitchen. I noted the sound of little feet trailing behind me. She was cheerful as ever, and continued on with her storytelling.

As I sat in my favorite chair, Jordan was already hoisting herself upon my knee. I reminded her that I needed a moment. Her response: she handed me the book we were to read from. The next chapter on our agenda was marked. A solid, unapologetic smile wrapped her face. Her eyes burrowed into my less formidable will power and within moments we were absorbed in our reading together.

That’s Jordan’s way. Jeanette has keenly observed that it is this determination, this unyielding ambition to have her way, that has kept Jordan alive. She insists on getting what she wants – a behavioral trait that tests our patience and sometimes makes for parenting challenges. But it is this quality of her persona that enables her to endure painful procedures, unwanted hospital stays, and the tedious pace of cancer treatment.

Early in her most recent chemo cycle, she experienced slight nausea. Ordinarily, she handles the chemo doses quite well. It’s remarkable that she doesn’t get sicker. But a few weeks ago she did get sick, and the way she dealt with it characterizes her point of view. It was a weekday morning and we were sitting down to breakfast. Pancakes were on the menu – the house favorite, and Jordan’s sinful breakfast pleasure. She’d been in for chemo the day before, but at the start of our morning she was feeling just fine, and eager to cut into her stack of cakes.

A few minutes later she excused herself from the table and headed towards her bedroom. We thought nothing of it. She often “takes breaks” from her food. But a moment later I could hear her vomiting in the bathroom. Jeanette and I rushed over. Throwing up always upsets Jordan. It’s more than the foul taste and the unpleasant feeling. She takes it as a personal failure. She gets mad at her body for betraying her. We comforted her and gave her a dose of anti-nausea medication. Ten minutes later she re-emerged from the bathroom, head high. And she went back to her pancakes. Perhaps her body wasn’t cooperating, but she wanted pancakes, and she was damn well going to have them.

But the proof of her resolve is obvious on a grander scale. Consider this: at this time last year Jordan was admitted to the hospital every week as part of a concentrated physical therapy effort to regain the use of her legs and mitigate nerve damage from chemotherapy. She entered the hospital using a wheelchair. She left on her own two legs, with help from a walker. Today, she has “graduated” from outpatient physical therapy – no more weekly trips. The doctors feel she is making fantastic progress on her own. So much progress, in fact, that Jordan returned to ballet class two weeks ago. And when I arrived home one night last week, she ran to me. She ran – not the hobbled skip we’ve gotten used to, but a full run: body forward, legs in motion, feet in control.

She has weaned off of the most powerful anti-seizure medications, and doing well. She’s completed yet another chemo cycle and stayed healthy. Her blood counts have been strong. And, in a few weeks, she’ll return to school – a new school that offers her so much promise that she talks about it every day.

Which brings me back to the cause and effect relationship: how will all of this shape the woman she is to become? When her health is no longer the issue, will she continue to push on to a new challenge? Will she grow into one of those prescient, patient leaders who somehow accomplish greatness by staying focused within a landscape of miniature distractions? Will she be disappointed by the triviality of so much that we face in “ordinary life?” Will she be too hard, distant to those who flirt with her, or too self-absorbed to allow anyone close? There is no way to tell, of course. But the realm of possibility is a fascinating comfort. How much better to ponder the “what”, than dread the “if”.

Next … a look at her brother, who has also been shaped by Jordan’s Journey.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jordan&rsquo;s MRI went well. She did not like getting accessed and fought the nurses more than usual, but everything otherwise went as planned. The radiologist&rsquo;s report is due tomorrow, but a preliminary scan by her doctor seems to show stable progress &ndash; no new growth (and no new reduction). She&rsquo;s a little groggy from the anesthesia. Tomorrow she begins her new chemo cycle.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-5615676158753446251?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A Great Wish Fulfilled</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img style="float:none;clear:left;" src="http://www.jordanvincent.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/larry_jordan.jpg" alt="Larry &amp; Jordan Snap" /><br /><strong>Jordan and I take a break from meeting with princesses to pose for a photo</strong><br /><br />We are back in Pasadena&ndash;and we&rsquo;re exhausted. No alarms this morning. The family fell in as each member awoke. We greeted the day with a big platter of pancakes and large pots of tea.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />We spent all day Saturday at Epcot. In the morning we breakfasted in Norway at a special Princess affair. Our family was announced to the room as the &ldquo;Royal Family Vincent&rdquo; with Jordan leading the procession with pomp and circumstance. Jordan met Belle, Aurora, Jasmine, Mulan and Snow White. She never tired of meeting with the princesses. She hugged each one and politely asked for their autographs. She was hoping to meet Mary Poppins, but Mary didn&rsquo;t join the breakfast party.<br /><br />When breakfast was done we enjoyed the rides in Future World. Test Track was the undisputed family favorite. After we&rsquo;d visited every pavilion worth visiting, we made our way to World Showcase. The kids particularly liked lunch at the Rose &amp; Crown Pub (and I enjoyed the Bass tap), then we ventured across the street to the Toy Soldier. Mary Poppins was meeting with visitors in the courtyard. If Jordan had a bull whip, she would have used it on me to get her wheelchair there faster.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.jordanvincent.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/marypoppins.jpg" alt="Mary Poppins and Our Family" /><br /><strong>The family poses with Mary Poppins</strong><br /><br />It was another one of those &ldquo;magic moments.&rdquo; The handler ushered her to the front of the line and Jordan gushed over Mary Poppins. She told Mary how she practiced her advice, and took all her medicine. She even confessed that her daddy once gave her a spoonful of sugar to coax her to take all her meds. Mary&rsquo;s eyes gazed over at me with a look of sudden understanding, but she didn&rsquo;t break character. She told Jordan that it was good to listen to her mummy and her nanny &hellip; and her daddy, too. Jordan hugged her tightly, told her how much she loved her and then got her autograph. Mary insisted that we take a photograph with her as a family. Jordan was very pleased.<br /><br />We had dinner in Paris. By this time &ndash; day #6 &ndash; the family was showing signs of wear and tear. We&rsquo;d been going non-stop and despite all the magic and fun, we began getting on each other&rsquo;s nerves. But we managed to have a pleasant dinner. We discussed our favorite moments. The rock wall won as the most popular memory. Jordan&rsquo;s favorite ride was Grand Prix (Autopia). Luc&rsquo;s was Test Track. Nettie favored Tower of Terror and I most enjoyed Hulk.<br /><br />Throughout the trip, Jordan was fearless. We took her on Tower of Terror when we were at MGM. She loved it. We have a great photo of her making a funny face during the image capture. I&rsquo;ll have to scan it because we don&rsquo;t have a digital version yet. She would have rode the coasters, had we allowed her. It was fascinating to watch her in action. I wouldn&rsquo;t say that she didn&rsquo;t have fears or anxiety. She did. It&rsquo;s the way that she takes no counsel of her fears that inspires. It&rsquo;s her mission to face down the daunting. Although, there are some frights she cannot tolerate. In the Haunted Mansion was a large, sculpted spider. It wasn&rsquo;t even animated. She grabbed my arm and exclaimed, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the spider!&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Jordan, it&rsquo;s just pretend. It doesn&rsquo;t even move.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it. I&rsquo;m going to close my eyes. I don&rsquo;t even want to THINK about it.&rdquo;<br /><br />I got a laugh out of that. Drops she can handle. Surgeries, too. Plastic spiders &ndash; she doesn&rsquo;t even want to think about them.<br /><br />On the flight home I asked Jordan if she had a good time. She smiled and told me it was the greatest time she could remember. She had so much fun &ndash; and she rarely tired out. She did confide that she was happy to be going home.<br /><br />&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to sleep in my own bed, watch my own tv and play on my own computer.&rdquo;<br /><br />She turned in early last night. But she was among the first to rise this morning. She helped me prepare breakfast, just like she always does &ndash; in her apron and with a smile.<br /><br />The Make-A-Wish Foundation delivered a great wish for Jordan. The people at Give Kids the World and all of the theme parks pampered her spectacularly. She never waited in a line. She received special attention throughout. Thank you to everyone who helped make it possible. And thank you to everyone who followed along.<br /><br />Jordan has a busy week ahead. Tomorrow she restarts physical and occupational therapy. Wednesday she goes in for an MRI (keep your fingers crossed). Thursday, she starts her next chemo cycle. She&rsquo;s taking her autograph book and many photos along with her to share with her friends at Children&rsquo;s Hospital. The memories from last week will serve as a spoonful of sugar.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-4315908225192841152?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was a slower paced day, but no less fun. We spent the majority of it at Disney/MGM. Jordan proved to be the venerable thrill-seeker we&rsquo;ve come to know and love. She rode Tower of Terror with us, and even made a funny pose for the image capture system. The highlight of her day was seeing Ariel in the Little Mermaid stage show. She&rsquo;s looking forward to tomorrow &ndash; when she has breakfast with the princesses at Epcot.<br /><br /><img style="float:none;" src="http://www.jordanvincent.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/brown_derby.jpg" alt="Family at Brown Derby" /><br /><strong>The family dines at The Brown Derby</strong></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-3863270846167382296?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.jordanvincent.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/jordan_cindy.jpg" alt="Jordan and Cinderella" /><br /><strong>Jordan shares a story with Cinderella while getting her autograph</strong><br /><br />Day 4 finally came &ndash; our trip to the Magic Kingdom. For the record, our &ldquo;rest day&rdquo; on day #3 was not very restful. Instead of lounging leisurely as we planned, we spent many hours out of the room shopping and being pampered. While Jordan and Jeanette were over at the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique getting Jordan&rsquo;s princess makeover, Luc and I decided to spend some quality time alone together on the links.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />It can be said that Luc has earned a wish or two himself. He&rsquo;s been an anchor for Jordan throughout her journey. He&rsquo;s tougher than I give him credit. And though we work very hard to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t happen, inevitably Luc makes a few sacrifices because of Jordan&rsquo;s condition.<br /><br />About a year ago, we started going out for an occasional game of golf. I&rsquo;m a terrible golfer and he&rsquo;s just getting started. We make quite a twosome. But the time together is always good: just us, our clubs, and the greens. That&rsquo;s what we did Wednesday. We played nine holes on Disney&rsquo;s beautiful Oak Trails executive course. We walked over two miles on a gorgeous day, and we both enjoyed it.<br /><br />After the golf, the makeover, and a filling lunch, we went back to the hotel and hit the pool. No matter that the weather was chilly. We hit the pool, because that&rsquo;s what the kids wanted to do. Fortunately, the pool was heated. It was still grueling to make that cool walk from the water to the pool deck, though. We finished the evening at Emeril&rsquo;s Tchoup Chop and turned in.<br /><br />Then Thursday came&hellip;<br /><br />Jordan has been going on about Magic Kingdom since she got here. A true California girl, she refers to it as Disneyland, even though we correct her everytime. The most important part of the trip for her was meeting the characters. That&rsquo;s how she started her day. Give Kids the World hosts a character photo opp. Jordan went on stage with Mickey and Minnie and posed with her family for some great photos. Then we headed over to Magic Kingdom and headed straight for Toontown Fair so that she could get autographs from all the princesses and some of her other favorite characters.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.jordanvincent.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/jordan_minnie.jpg" alt="Jordan and Minnie" /><br /><strong>Jordan was excited to meet Minnie</strong><br /><br />Four long days of constant walking are starting to take their toll on her stamina. She suggested we rent a wheelchair when we arrive, and we thought that was a good idea. It helped us circumnavigate the park without wearing her out too much. She took in all the usual rides (Pirates, Haunted Mansion, Dumbo, etc.). She also had lunch at Tony&rsquo;s on Main Street Square (having recently read Lady &amp; The Tramp together). Of course, she and I had to eat the same spaghetti noodle and meet in the middle, just like Lady and Tramp.<br /><br />We ended our day with a long dinner at California Grill. The food was delicious. The company engaging. Luc and Jordan colored the entire face of our paper table cloth &ndash; so beautiful that we rolled it up to take it home. And, as luck would have it, we finished our meal in time to watch the fireworks over Cinderella&rsquo;s castle.<br /><br />We were exhausted by the time we returned to the hotel, and pledged to sleep in this morning. Our next stop is Disney/MGM. More to come&hellip;</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-2883217182521946751?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Wish Day #2: Quest for the Hard Ones</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[She is a child who confounds any notion I have of strength. Just when I think I’ve seen her grandest statement of perseverance, she proves me wrong – and nothing makes me happier.

She attacked her first day in Orlando with Herculean strength. Nothing could slow her down. It was a day chalk full of events. Her answer to each: next! It was a chore to keep up with her.

We began our day with a family breakfast at Tratoria del Porto. Jordan ate her fill of pancakes, eggs and bacon (she has the stomach of a midwesterner). Everyone drank tea (except me). We toasted the beginning of Jordan’s wish and pledged to have fun.

Our first stop: Give Kids the World, a non-profit resort in Central Florida that creates magical memories for children with life- threatening illnesses – and our hosts. After a brief orientation in which we received many gifts, we toured the campus. Jordan autographed a gold star that will soon be affixed to the inner ceiling of the magic castle at the resort, along with hundreds of other children who have realized their wishes. The kids played in the game room until Jordan realized there was a carousel. Within a short time she had negotiated with the cast members to fire it up. Soon she and several other guests were whirling around in circles. After a train ride along the grounds, we were off to our first theme park stop – Universal’s _Islands of Adventure_ (IOA).<a name="more"></a>

I have always though of IOA as Orlando’s best kept secret. It’s one of the most beautiful parks, packed full of things to do. The only trouble is that Jordan is somewhat restricted in her activity. Because of her illness, rollercoasters are a hazard. Unfortunately, she *loves* rollercoasters – and Universal has some of the best. Nevertheless, we encouraged her to sample the parks other many attractions, and she was not dissatisfied.

The people at the park treated her like royalty. As part of her wish, Universal extended her a gold pass, a lanyard that prompted cast members to escort her to the front of the line. People stopped to talk to her and allow her carte blanche. She accepted graciously, charismatically … with a charisma that visibly moved others to ponder why this child was being granted a wish in the first place. This was not a child facing a life-threatening illness. This was a child in search of adventure. This was a girl daring attractions and novelties to make her giggle.

She sought out all the rides her doctors would allow. We managed to take in one rollercoaster, a child’s ride that wasn’t too risky. She held her hands above her head and cheered throughout.

We rode Spiderman. She thought it was loud, but loved the experience.

We rode the carousel – twice.

And then we came to the rock wall.

Jordan loves rock walls. Whenever we go to REI or a mall that has one, she finagles her way into a try. She never makes it. Usually, she gets about five feet off the ground and can’t quite figure out how to get any higher. She gets frustrated and throws in the towel.

When she saw the rock wall today, she asked to try again. We rolled our eyes. We tried to divert her attention. She would not be subdued.

I asked her, “Jordan, why do you want to do the rock wall when you only get a few feet and stop?”

Before she could answer, I realized the significance of my stupid question. We actually answered simultaneously.

“Because I can do it this time.”

I realized that the rock wall was a perfect metaphor for Jordan’s illness and her journey. It doesn’t matter what setbacks she’s encountered before. She can always try to scale the wall again. And this time, she might actually get to the top to ring the bell.

We signed the kids up. Jordan was first. While they waited in line, Luc bragged about whether he wanted to do an “easy one” or a “medium one”. Jordan exclaimed: “I want to do the hard one.” I looked at Jeanette and shook my head.

“Jeesh, Jordan. Can’t you do something easy for once in your life?!”

Jeanette laughed and we convinced Jordan to try an “easy one” before attempting the “hard one”.

Jordan started her climb with her usual level of determination. And she climbed pretty high – halfway up. Then I noticed the look on her face. She was afraid. She started looking down. She struggled to find her footing. Her hands trembled. And soon, she jumped back and repelled downward.

We cheered her, congratulated her, clapped and hooted. She was not amused.

Luc went next. He scaled his way to the top like some kind of monkey, rang the bell and floated back to the earth’s surface. He was allowed two tries, so he went again. This time he chose a more difficult face, and again he scaled the wall and rang the bell. Jordan motioned that she was ready to try again.

It only took a couple of minutes, but it felt like the world slowed down. People had gathered around us, but none of them knew about Jordan. They were watching their own children. But every so often, they’d look over their shoulders at the girl in the pink sweatshirt. She was determined. The force of her will pushed the air aside and cold-cocked innocent bystanders. Her face was pale and cross; absent of joy.

Halfway up the wall I couldn’t breathe. I watched as Jordan commanded her knees to rise, dug her heels into the edges and hoisted her body up. Every step mattered. It wasn’t graceful. It was dirty and committed, brash and intimidating. She fought the rock face like it was a villain. Even in that brief moment, I reflected on what she was doing. A year ago she couldn’t walk, now she was scaling a wall – and damnit, the wall was going to go the same way as the wheelchair.

The final moments I’ll never forget. She was getting tired. There was only a couple of yards left in the elevation. She used her knees. She foisted her body upward in spite of gravity. The bell was within reach and it taunted her. We cheered from below, careful to give her room to fail. But failure is not part of Jordan’s way. She pushed and climbed … and she rang that bell. She rang it long enough to hear it sound in her ears and then she repelled herself down.

People we didn’t know clapped and cheered her. Jeanette and I looked at one another. Neither of us had dry eyes. Luc was the first to notice.

“Hey, look, mom and dad are crying.”

Jordan replied, “they’re crying because they’re happy!”

I nodded, lifted her up and held her tight. Jeanette hugged us both. The cast member shook our hands and congratulated Jordan. Oddly, she was ready to move on to the next ride. She allowed us to relish the moment, but it was clear that all she was thinking was: next!

Watching her scale that rock was the most humbling experience of my life. If ever I doubt her ability to fight cancer, all I need to do is look at the photo of her reaching for that bell. She doesn’t know how to do anything but fight and push on. It’s beautiful.

We finished the evening with a long dinner at Emeril’s. Jordan ate her fill of pizza and Shirley Temples.

And this was only our first day…

She loved rock walls, but could never really scale them because of the weakness in her legs. The year before this photo was taken she was completely wheelchair-bound, the result of a rare reaction to Vincristine, a fairly common chemotherapy drug. But Jordan re-learned to walk through intense physical therapy. And, on this day, she surprised us all when, engaged in an intense competitive rivalry with her brother, she willed herself up that wall and rang the bell. It’s a wonder that we were able to take the photos. Our eyes were so wet. [&#8230;]]]></wp:comment_content>

She is wearing her &ldquo;travel clothes&rdquo; &ndash; a pink Juicy Couture track suit provided by her Auntie Lisa</strong><br /><br />We&rsquo;re off! Jordan could not be more excited. Our day began when a stretch limo arrived at our house at 7:15am. Jeanette and I were still scurrying about packing the bags while the kids were climbing into the big sedan, lounging in style.<br /><br />Our travels have never been easier. Both flights left on time and arrived early. And the folks at Make-A-Wish went out of their way to make it easy for us to get from point A to point B.<br /><br />We dined at &lsquo;Ohana at the Polynesian Resort. Jordan danced the hula, paraded with the limbo line and got so excited about seeing Cinderella&rsquo;s castle that she skipped dessert (she wanted to see more). When we arrived at Universal&rsquo;s Portofino Bay Hotel, we were all rightly tuckered. We were delighted by our &ldquo;kids suite&rdquo;, with a colorful room for the kids and a plush bed for mom and dad. Jordan grabbed my hand and said, &ldquo;I love our new home.&rdquo;<br /><br />More to come tomorrow. We&rsquo;re exhausted tonight.<br /><img style="clear:left;float:none;" src="http://www.jordanvincent.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/checkin.jpg" alt="Jordan Checks In at Polynesian" /><br /><br /><strong>Jordan earns a &ldquo;magical moment&rdquo; by helping to check us in at the Polynesian</strong></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-7240310860403040815?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Next week, our family is headed to Orlando, Florida. The &ldquo;Make a Wish Foundation&rdquo;:http://www.wish.org is sending Jordan to Walt Disney World, something she&rsquo;s been bubbling about daily. Every day we revisit the countdown:<br /><br />&ldquo;Dad, is it Monday, yet?&rdquo;<br /><br />For the record, Walt Disney World was Jordan&rsquo;s backup wish. Her first wish was to appear on an episode of &ldquo;The Suite Life of Zack and Cody&rdquo;:http://psc.disney.go.com/disneychannel/suitelife/ on The Disney Channel. We got as far as an invitation to a taping and a backstage meeting with her favorite twins, but my little diva wanted camera time &ndash; and that&rsquo;s a bit harder to pull off. She was happy to revert to her backup plan.<br /><br />We look forward to many things in the new year. We pray for Jordan&rsquo;s health and victory in her battle with cancer. We find promise in her strength, her will and her buoyant spirit. We celebrate the generosity and kindness of our friends and family, knowing that we will never be alone, no matter where the year takes us. And we focus on hope &ndash; hope for healing, hope for the wisdom of her doctors, hope for courage and strength, and hope for many celebrations.<br /><br />I think Disney World is a good way to start.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-2219217321027495128?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.jordanvincent.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/jordan_recent_1206.jpg" alt="Miracle Girl" /><br />I have developed a disdain for religion. I suppose I should clarify that statement. I am overwhelmed by the depth of religious communities. The communities give me hope. Our family has survived Jordan&rsquo;s Journey on the backs of our friends at All Saints Church. We have been touched by the generosity, compassion and love of people we hardly know, connected to us solely by the threads of association with our church. It is the <em>community</em> in the phrase &ldquo;community of faith&rdquo; that I cherish.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />My quarrel is with G-d. I often curse him, frequently question his motives, constantly hold him in contempt. Sometimes, I get so mad and can&rsquo;t find anything to say so I just throw him the bird. (Believe it or not, I was advised to do so by a priest some years back. His reasoning was that it was better to flip G-d off than stop talking to him altogether.) And yes, with the mess we have down here, I&rsquo;m convinced G-d is a man. If G-d were a woman, I&rsquo;d probably have less reason to complain. I&rsquo;d probably have less reason to question whether or not She existed.<br /><br />I worship at the temple of logic. And the problem with religion is that most of it is based on flawed logic. People believe anyway, until someone points out the giant gap in the reasoning. That&rsquo;s when religion usually delivers the greatest insult of all. We&rsquo;re told to have faith. It&rsquo;s a mystery, we&rsquo;re told. We must believe and have faith.<br /><br />Hogwash.<br /><br />That&rsquo;s where religion loses me. I ask simple questions. Why would G-d afflict my child with such a nasty disease? To teach her a lesson? Because it is part of a divine plan? What kind of plan? He&rsquo;s a loving G-d, right? Compassionate? Then why select a child for his plan? What kind of sentient being would design this path? I have recently had reason to ask these questions again.<br /><br />On Christmas Eve, Jordan lost a friend. Her name was Jenna. They met a year ago at a camp organized by CHLA for brain tumor patients. Jenna and Jordan were about the same age, with very similar interests. They both had older brothers, and Luc enjoyed playing with Jacob during the long weekend retreat. Both girls had endured surgery and long stays in the hospital. But Jenna&rsquo;s tumors were far more aggressive. Unlike Jordan&rsquo;s cancer&ndash;a big, slow bully&ndash;Jenna&rsquo;s cancer was crafty, fast and dangerous. The girls were often hospitalized at the same time, but Jenna was usually isolated &ndash; the result of experimental, debilitating drug therapies that compromised her immune system. A couple of months ago we received word that Jenna was being sent home for hospice care. Her doctors exhausted all options, but the disease was too strong. On Christmas Eve, Jenna passed away at home with her family.<br /><br />The news of Jenna&rsquo;s passing saddened us all. Our thoughts and our prayers were with her family yesterday as we sat down to have our Christmas dinner. Jordan delivered grace. In her prayer she asked G-d to let Jenna have fun in heaven. She wished for her friend to find others who have passed on &ndash; people Jordan thought Jenna would like to meet. Ella Fitzgerald made the list. So did our cat Max and our dog Misha. I bowed my head and prayed with her, but inside I continued my combative dialogue with G-d. It&rsquo;s an absurd discourse. I argue that I don&rsquo;t believe in him anymore, but then &hellip; I&rsquo;m speaking to him, so I must believe, no matter how much it makes me cringe. I must believe something or I&rsquo;d feel perfectly comfortable writing his name in this post, which the bible says is forbidden. Then again, I imagine it&rsquo;s forbidden to flip Him off. I guess He gets the last laugh once again.<br /><br />In recent weeks I&rsquo;ve found a new source of faith. It&rsquo;s an odd feeling, not the least bit spiritual in my rendering of the definition. There are no visions of angels or profound meditations on scripture. I haven&rsquo;t been born again and I certainly haven&rsquo;t increased attendance at church. My new faith springs from the girl, from Jordan. All the logic and reason and science can&rsquo;t explain her. It troubles and comforts me in the same wisping burst of revelation. She is a miracle.<br /><br />Not three months ago, she lay still in a hospital bed, unable to eat or speak. She could barely communicate with us. Half of her body was paralyzed. She was plagued by seizures, some so strong they lasted over an hour. Even after she was discharged from the hospital, she was besotted by a heaviness. It weighed upon her, slowed her, made her distant.<br /><br />That isn&rsquo;t the girl in our house today. Watching her these past few weeks, I giggle and gush. During a holiday program at Luc&rsquo;s school, I looked over at Jordan. She watched the show with intent, smiling ear to ear. When it was over, she ran to him in the foyer, cheeks raised with a buoyant grin, eyes wide with life. It&rsquo;s a miracle. It is humbling, inspiring and frustratingly puzzling. It is also remarkably beautiful. People who know her stare with their mouths wide open. They watch incredibly as she dances, skips and chatters rapidly. She occupies her time hunting for springs of life, finding them readily and sharing them with those of us too jaded to remember how refreshing life can be when seen through the eyes of a child.<br /><br />I don&rsquo;t know where that puts me with G-d. He and I are anything but square. But maybe it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Jenna&rsquo;s passing has reminded our family to enjoy today&rsquo;s blessings as they come, to enjoy each day with Jordan and marvel at the wonder of the girl we love madly. My faith is strengthened by her. She moves me to accept life for what it is &ndash; an inexplicable jumble of chaos often producing staggering results. Some call them miracles, I call it Jordan.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-8167774390657764788?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m sorry I have not posted in awhile. Part of the reason is that we&rsquo;ve been busy with the usual family shenanigans that accompany this time of year. But I&rsquo;ve also avoided posting because I&rsquo;m superstitious and Jordan has been doing exceptionally well. The quick version of the story: she&rsquo;s very mobile, feeling very well, and exceedingly happy. She&rsquo;s on a break from chemo for the next few weeks (which adds to the happiness).<br /><br />I&rsquo;ll post more soon.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-1634390028225320168?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wish there was a more eloquent way to say she&rsquo;s doing great. She is. So I will. She&rsquo;s doing great.<br /><br />And I probably notice it more than others in the family because I&rsquo;ve been traveling so much. Being away for several days only makes her progress more apparent. Her progress is staggering. I go away and when I come back she&rsquo;s more vibrant, animated and &hellip; well, Jordan.<br /><br />Her physical therapy team re-evaluated her this week. While she still has some physical deficits on her right side, in other areas she is actually more capable than she was before her hospitalization.<br /><br />The truth is, she overpowers everyone who visits her. No one can believe this was the same girl who was comatose only a few weeks ago &ndash; even her doctors. We are naturally apprehensive. It&rsquo;s easy for her force of will to misdirect our attention; make us think she is smashing when another storm is brewing. But she&rsquo;s magnificent in her comebacks!<br /><br />Before I end this brief post between airport visits, I want to send my gratitude to everyone for the abundant support. While I&rsquo;ve been away, I&rsquo;ve taken comfort in the blanket of friends and family that look after my family. Every night Jeanette and the kids have had a good hot meal without having to worry about how to fix it. It&rsquo;s hard to express how grateful we are and how much that means. One less thing for Jeanette to worry about, and a giant reminder that we are not alone in Jordan&rsquo;s Journey. Thank you.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-7215084257150654808?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She sleeps in a pink castle, cream colored cheeks against a fluffy purple pillow. The castle is really a square tent with four spires and an arched entry flap. She asked her mom to erect it in her room next to her bed. Last night it is where she slept, and this afternoon it is where she napped. Through the mesh windows I spied her, resting contentedly in a blissful stillness.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />Her progress this week defies imagination. She gaits pleasantly from room to room, pushing forward with cheer and an appetite for life. She has quite an appetite for food, too. Her mood astonishes us all. What once was subdued and somewhat depressing has evolved into a curious maturity. The old soul inside her broke loose, shook the dust from her shoes and set upon living rather than recovering.<br /><br />Yet, still, that maturity. It measures more than the stamina of the child. It sizes possibility and fixes to render it tangible. She rejects the concept of no, and does it without swagger. The maturity displays with quiet confidence. I believe she has a ledger of goals hidden in her incessant mind. She never discusses the goals, just lets them hang in her sights. Then she achieves them one by one without marking the accomplishment to those of us watching stunned from the sidelines.<br /><br />She speaks deliberately, liberally relying on ambiguous pronouns when her mind cannot find the specific words she needs to express her thoughts. There is less inflection in her voice, but the monotonic tone adds to her presence. She accents her phrases with sweeping hand gestures and an animated brow.<br /><br />Throughout her illness the experts have often advised us to believe in the resilience of children. I doubt they imagined Jordan&rsquo;s power. She casts a spell on us all. Hers is a determined magic.<br /><br />She greeted me this morning on her usual progress to the kitchen pantry. I helped her pour some milk. We chatted for a few minutes before she went back to her room to dress. She moved a few steps from me when I asked her to return. I wrapped my arms around her and cradled her head close to my chest. And then I whispered to her.<br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so proud of you. Most grown ups can&rsquo;t do what you do.&rdquo;<br /><br />She patted my back and replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud of me, too.&rdquo;</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-3237221126879788388?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a lot. Working in entertainment does that to you. There are a myriad of memories and experiences that caused me to sigh and feel so little in comparison to the apparition of greatness. A David Lean tracking shot. A Bob Dyland lyric. The helicopter onslaught in Apocalypse Now. The opening strains of Aida. A Hockney portrait.<br /><br />Jordan.<br /><br />She may be the most humbling experience of my life. She&rsquo;s so strong, so noble, so dignified. Watching her muster the energy to go trick-or-treating was a work of art. Slow, methodical, spirited &ndash; she set her mind to celebrating Halloween, and she did.<br /><br />I tell you, there are few things more beautiful in life than watching this child march on. Every time I believe hope is sapped from my veins, she proves me ignorant. I draw strength from her countenance. I am humbled by her vibrance. She captivates without trying, resonates with little motion, and endears intoxicatingly.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-2503048101590918332?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="attachment_28" align="alignleft" width="236"]<img class="wp-image-28 size-medium" src="https://jordansjourney.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/tumblr_mx21g9k0zq1rn5v6ko2_r1_1280.jpg?w=236" alt="" width="236" height="300" /> Jordan and Larry Vincent in 2013[/caption]

<em>Jordan’s Journey</em> began in late December, 2002 when my then four year-old daughter Jordan Vincent started having debilitating headaches. By New Year’s Eve, her pain was so constant and severe that she couldn’t eat or sleep. Her doctors first thought it was a sinus infection, but when she started seeing double she was admitted to the hospital and her journey with cancer began.

Jordan is an amazing fighter. In fact, after over a decade beating cancer back again and again, we dubbed her the "cancer slayer."

I began writing this blog shortly after Jordan was diagnosed. Its original function was to manage the flow of information. It was too daunting for me to call all our friends and relay the latest updates in her healthcare story. So, I posted updates on a blog and asked everyone we knew to check there before calling us. Over time, the writer in me engaged and instead of just posting facts, I offloaded feelings and observations from our family life. It became a kind of therapy. I found that once I released the angst in my head, or shared the triumphs from our experience, I was stronger. I could be a better dad. It helped me support the slayer.

Jordan is still on her journey with cancer, but she is now a beautiful, resilient young lady who never backs away from the fight and only focuses on living every single day to its fullest.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The results from the MRI are in, and Jordan&rsquo;s condition is stable. It&rsquo;s not a very attractive word: stable. No real sex appeal. But, in her case, it&rsquo;s very good news. It means the drugs are working. When you combine the diagnosis with her buoyant personality and active behavior, stable is actually a very soothing word.<br /><br />She was quite pleased with the news &ndash; even left me a bubbly message to say so.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-2572570015590229580?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She goes in for MRI today. She has a lot of apprehension this time around. She asked about it constantly over the weekend, and bristled occasionally when she really thought about all that goes into it. It&rsquo;s a sign that she&rsquo;s getting older. She&rsquo;s mature enough to know what&rsquo;s going on. And she&rsquo;s asked this time to see pictures from the scan. For $5, she&rsquo;ll walk away with a disk full of images of the demon that stalks her everyday. She&rsquo;s very interested to see what her cancer looks like. I&rsquo;m very curious to see how she handles it, what she grasps, how it affects her.<br /><br />I didn&rsquo;t go with the girls today. Last night Jordan asked if I would hold her hand, like I usually do. I told her that Mommy would have to because I thought I would go to work. She smiled and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hold Mom&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo; Then she gave me a giant hug and started rambling on about all the things she was going to do Tuesday. We don&rsquo;t talk much about Mondays.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-6612185021768077565?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tomorrow, she starts again. Early in the morning, she&rsquo;ll have her breakfast, stay in her pajamas and ride with her mom to Children&rsquo;s Hospital to resume chemotherapy. She had a nice break for the holidays, and particularly enjoyed her time away from the needle. But it&rsquo;s time to start again.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />The start of every new year marks an odd anniversary for us. It was precisely five years ago that Jordan became symptomatic. The first signs occurred at Christmas. She had a headache. It wasn&rsquo;t a monster, but it was big enough to beckon a nap. When she awoke she seemed fine. The next day she had another headache. This one really bothered her. She tried to sleep it off, but when she awoke, it was still there. The next day we took her to the doctor, who prescribed antibiotics for a possible sinus infection. But the headache got worse. For two sleepless nights she cried in pain and vomited her antibiotics. When she started seeing double, she found herself in the hospital. Thus, in January 2003, Jordan began her battle with cancer.<br /><br />When Jeanette and I realized that five years had passed, we were a bit somber. It was an odd feeling. Our rational minds told us to rejoice. Jordan has survived five years and is in relatively good health. She is extraordinarily active. This holiday season she sang in the church choir. She relished the on-stage attention and performed with zeal. She dances, rides her bike and runs around the house just like any other kid. We have every reason to be cheerful. In fact, we celebrated her accomplishment as a family, with glasses of champagne and apple cider raised high. But, proud as we are of her remarkable resilience, we are also mindful of the disease. Five years is a very long time. After five years of treatment, she is still fighting cancer without any sign of victory. Jordan proudly exclaims to strangers that she is &ldquo;kicking cancer&rsquo;s butt,&rdquo; but she and the rest of the troops are tired. Our life is a series of compromises and compensatory actions. Sometimes, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine life without the disease.<br /><br />Much has been written about the power of positive thinking. We think positively as often as we can because it lets us all focus on living. Recently, Jordan&rsquo;s doctors have been very upbeat about her progress. They note miniscule reductions in the size of her tumor. We hear them confer and speak positively of her treatment. Though they may not agree about the nuances in her MRI film, they all agree about what they observe in the patient. They are astonished by her buoyancy and her restless wit. As we begin the sixth year of her journey, our family will do all that we can to preserve that spirit. And we thank all of you for helping us come this far.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-2734269024882535466?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She has a smile that strikes you when you&rsquo;re in the middle of exhaling and leaves you gasping for air. Sometimes, I watch her and she appears to move in slow motion. The gentle crinkles of her smiling mouth barely change the shape of her face. Her cheeks rise just enough to cast a light without dimming the gracefulness of her piercing eyes. When she smiles, it is with her whole face. It is brilliant.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.jordanvincent.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/img_0067_2.jpg" title="CPK" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.jordanvincent.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/img_0067_2.jpg" alt="CPK" /></a><br /><br />I watched her tonight, as our whole family camped in a booth at our local California Pizza Kitchen. We joked and laughed and played sport with one another. Occasionally, I&rsquo;d glance over and watch my daughter. She loves her family. She loves these times. It shows. She radiates, eager to giggle. She is the warmest person I&rsquo;ve ever known: living and loving with an enthusiasm that draws you in and gives you new life.<br /><br />A few weeks ago, a dear friend spent time with Jordan. When we were alone, he said to me, &ldquo;she seems to love making people laugh.&rdquo; He was right. She&rsquo;s an entertainer. Underneath that sometimes prickly, temperamental personality is a girl who loves to spread cheer. Even when those eyes look out and seem some place very far away, she has a presence that lifts you up. God bless her.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-7689801160707713971?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She resumed chemotherapy on Monday after a three-week break. She was anxious about starting up again, but the anxiety never spoiled her otherwise genial mood. We often say, &ldquo;Jordan gets it done.&rdquo; And indeed she does. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how much she may complain, lash out, or fret, she always does what is needed to combat her disease. She is a survivor.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />Yesterday morning, when Jeanette woke Jordan to see if she was up for school, she was greeted by a cranky admonishment. &ldquo;I want to sleep,&rdquo; Jordan complained. Jordan often misses school the day after chemo, but Jeanette was exercising due diligence. She rubbed Jordan&rsquo;s back for a moment and explained that she just wanted to check on her. She asked gently if Jordan felt like going to school, but she also gave Jordan the option to stay home and rest. There was a moment of quiet and then Jordan rolled over and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try, mom.&rdquo; A half hour later Jordan was boarding the school bus. The story humbled me. Had it been me the day after chemo, I don&rsquo;t know that I would have been as strong, matter-of-fact, or as pliable with my mood.<br /><br />Late last night, I awoke to the sound of Jordan stumbling down the hall. I heard her fall on the hardwood floor accompanied by a burping, liquid sound. She was trying to make it to the bathroom, but she was six feet short. I found her braced against the doorway, vomiting against her will. Her stomach was revolting against her, trying to rob of her of composure and dignity. This insubordination of her own body made her more angry than anything else.  I helped her into the bathroom and held her head, taking turns with Jeanette in comforting her and cleaning up. Jordan moaned slightly, &ldquo;I need to brush my teeth.&rdquo; Even in the midst of uncontrollable bodily function, her mind was set toward getting up, getting going and moving on. A few minutes later she was up and back in bed. I checked on her and asked how she was doing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m feeling much better,&rdquo; she said, then rolled over and fell asleep.<br /><br />Jeanette and I crawled back into our own bed. We lay silent in the darkness, close enough to throw an arm over one another. Jeanette whispered to me. &ldquo;Poor thing.&rdquo; I thought about it for a moment and resisted the urge to fall apart. I was dumbstruck by the cold reality of cancer and the resilience of my daughter. People ask me where we get the strength to keep going. I always point straight to Jordan. She is strong enough for our entire family. She is an awesome force of will and circumstance and unshakable resolve. She is a survivor.<br /><br />Every year at Thanksgiving, we reflect on the many blessings Jordan&rsquo;s journey has brought us. Her strength is certainly one, the kindness of our friends another. Most of all, we are thankful for Jordan&rsquo;s continued health. In addition to her will and the support of those around us, Jordan is healthy because of the hard work and ongoing research by her doctors and research hospitals like Children&rsquo;s Hospital Los Angeles. We hope you will join us again this year in supporting your favorite pediatric cancer cause. CHLA is our preferred charity, but there are many wonderful organizations out there who are helping children like Jordan fight cancer and live productive lives &ndash; helping them survive. Happy Thanksgiving.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-6574235185739738468?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>To Dodge a Curse</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We savored every last bite of our Mexican food before making our way to the patio to carve the pumpkins. Luc was already in his costume, a white t-shirt inscribed with a self-designed iron-on that read &ldquo;this is my Halloween costume. Deal with it.&rdquo; Jordan was halfway through her transformation into the Princess Aurora from Sleeping Beauty. It was a thoroughly Southern California holiday, with the temperature lingering in the mid 70&rsquo;s, and our family was ready for a celebration. In fact, we had just corked a bottle of champagne and toasted Jordan&rsquo;s health. She had broken a curse.<br /><a name="more"></a><br /><br />People are usually surprised to learn how superstitious I am. I&rsquo;m not one of those black-cat-in-your-path kind of guys. In fact, I think my superstitions are perfectly rational. I never speak of Macbeth in a theatre because it&rsquo;s bad form, not just because it is believed to welcome an accident. I don&rsquo;t discuss the plots of stories I&rsquo;m writing because I worry that letting the idea flow before it gets on paper will soften my creativity, not because it will jinx the story. These predilections make sense to me, but I wouldn&rsquo;t say that they lead me to believe in curses. Yet a curse plagued our family for four years. It was the October curse, and it is the reason I did not post to the blog for a month. It was the reason why every time Jeanette&rsquo;s phone number popped up on my caller ID, I shuddered a bit. It was the reason why all of us demurred somewhat whenever we were asked to share how Jordan was doing last month. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s doing great,&rdquo; we would say. And leave it at that.<br /><br />October 8, 2004. We sat anxiously in the surgical waiting room of Children&rsquo;s Hospital. Jordan was up in the O.R.   The neurosurgical biopsy had taken over two hours. Minutes after we watched the Angels swept by the Red Sox in the final game of the ALDS, her doctor greeted us to tell us that the surgery went well. It is the first time that we are told she may have cancer. And in the days that follow, the diagnosis is confirmed and cancer joins our family.<br /><br />October, 2005. After an unexpected onset of seizures in August, Jordan&rsquo;s medical team begins a more aggressive chemotherapy regimen.  By Halloween, 2005, she is thinner, paler and developing an usual gait. By Thanksgiving, she is in a wheelchair, crippled by a rare side effect from the chemo drugs.<br /><br />October 16, 2006. Jordan visits CHLA for a routine chemotherapy appointment. She is brilliant, cooperating with the nurses and managing her anxieties well. Minutes before she is to be de-accessed and sent home, the team notices unusual behavior. Her speech is slurred. One side of her face is drooping. There is fear in her eyes. She is admitted and slips into a coma for nearly a week. At one point, the seizures are so severe that they last for over an hour and put her into respiratory distress. It is the darkest hour our family has faced, putting a damper on our zest for autumn. Though Jordan is home in time for Halloween and she displays a remarkable ability to bounce back, we are convinced there&rsquo;s something about October. We spend the next eleven months dreading it&rsquo;s return.<br /><br />When October 1st rolled around this year, it became the month that must not be discussed. I believe you can squelch your phobias by shining a light on them. That&rsquo;s why I acknowledged the curse outright at a family dinner.<br /><br />&ndash;You guys watch. This will be the year that Jordan crushes the curse.<br /><br />Jeanette locked eyes with me over her dinner plate. She looked slightly annoyed, perhaps shocked that I would speak of the curse so openly with the children. But she&rsquo;s learned to tolerate my spontaneous pronouncements. I was, however, on my own with this one. The questions started rolling from the kids&ndash;Jordan in particular. Within a few minutes, we were all talking about Octobers past and our wishes for a healthy autumn. Somehow, the curse seemed less daunting. We had exposed it prowling over there in the corner, robbed it of its mystery and empowered its victim to take it on. Still, it was early in the month, and we were reluctant to taunt the monster. We worried she would trip and bump her head every time she grabbed the hula hoop in the backyard. We winced whenever she visited the hospital. We hovered over her and shortened the leash of activity we&rsquo;d normally allow. This was October and we were determined she would be healthy. So was she.<br /><br />October came and went and Jordan is well. She&rsquo;s on a brief break from chemo to let her counts increase. Despite spikes in her moods and ongoing fatigue, she bursts vibrantly into life with wit and charm and hope. October&rsquo;s passing doesn&rsquo;t make us rest that much easier, but we mark the milestones we can, for there are few times we&rsquo;ve had cause to celebrate in Jordan&rsquo;s Journey. It&rsquo;s all too easy to surrender to fear and allow ourselves to slip into melancholy. Worrying casts a pallor on the journey and weighs each new step with unnecessary dread. We&rsquo;re on a path we cannot chart and a destination we must imagine bright. So we celebrate victory over our fears and the stamina of a heroine who breaks curses and lives eager to battle the next foe.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-3615051946954898324?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She bounced into the room wearing her complete collection of cardinal and gold. Behind her, on the television, USC had just kicked off its home game against Washington State. Jordan rolled her arms and shouted out to rally support from the living room audience, proudly showing off her USC sweatshirt.<br /><br />&ndash; Give me a U! Give me an S! Give me a C! What&rsquo;s that spell?<br /><br /><br />Sometimes she gets it backwards.<br /><br /><br />&ndash; Give me an S! Give me a U! Give me a C! What&rsquo;s that spell?<br />We all chant: SUC! She just glowers at us, then corrects herself.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />We indulged her calls for spirit gladly and gently reminded her to step away from the television. She lept onto my lap and cheered every play &hellip; every 2-yard screen pass, every crushing run into the Washington defense, every extra point after our many touchdowns. During commercials, she&rsquo;d rattle on about going to USC one day to become a cheerleader and then a nurse. Usually, these pronouncements were made while she munched on chips and dip, her favorite football snack.<br /><br />She had a great weekend, showing some of her best behavior. It&rsquo;s still touch and go sometimes, but when she works hard at it, she&rsquo;s buoyant and pleasant. She&rsquo;s a child who just loves to cuddle. She enjoys sneaking up on you and pouncing with a &ldquo;boo!&rdquo; She loves to laugh, sometimes so hard she doubles over, and her laugh is infectious. Most of all, she loves to make us laugh. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my job,&rdquo; she&rsquo;ll say, &ldquo;to crack my family up.&rdquo;<br /><br />This weekend we noticed that she had boundless energy. She rose early, then started many self-imposed projects. Notably, cleaning her room never made her short list, though it was one we emphasized as a priority. She practiced her hula hoop, rode her bike, played with the dog and produced a series of colorful drawings. She was always on the go, which was sometimes annoying to the grown ups who longed for a few minutes of quiet rest. But Jeanette and I never complain too much about seeing her so animated and engaged.<br /><br />It is the last week in September, and the unusually cold, wet weekend whet all of our appetites for autumn. But it also renewed superstitious dread. The month of October has not been kind to our family these past three years. Last year Jordan was comatose and hospitalized for over a week in October. The year before she began her slow dissent into chemotherapy troubles. And the year before, she was diagnosed. The month that throughout my life has brought me the greatest sense of living has only recently become a month of doubt. We are tiptoeing into autumn this year, and hopeful when we watch Jordan balance so many accomplishments in her current life.<br /><br />On Sunday we had friends over for an informal feast. It was a beautiful afternoon. The day had warmed enough that we ended up on the front driveway in our shirt sleeves, throwing a football around. Luc has joined the football team at his school and the pigskin finds its way into virtually everything he does. Jordan wanted to play in our game of catch. Watching her was a pleasure. She cocked the ball back behind her ear as her face transformed into a grimmace of determination and aggression. Her lip curled, ner nose crinckled and her eyes squinted as she focused on her target, and with a grunt she&rsquo;d throw the ball as hard as she could. I&rsquo;ve often heard coaches and trainers tell their athletes to &ldquo;get mad at it.&rdquo; Jordan does. Nothing slows her. She wants to do everything. And our fingers are crossed that this fall she will.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-9182264595542878911?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It was time for a break. Nearly twelve weeks of uninterrupted chemotherapy, a long summer, and a career change (I’m starting a new job in a week) demanded a week to just do nothing. The family needed to retreat somewhere with a pool and five-star service. We needed to be pampered. But we couldn’t go far. Jordan has another chemo appointment today and an MRI procedure scheduled for Friday. So we chose to stay close to home – to vacation “in town” – so we checked in at the W Westwood, about 30 miles from home.<!--more-->
The W is taking great care of us. We were upgraded to a penthouse suite. It’s a pet-friendly hotel, so our dog Gracie is with us, and between pampering Gracie and pampering Jordan, our family is getting lots of attention. But that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s gone smoothly… <a name="more"></a>

Jordan is in an angry way. She has been for several weeks. Her temper flares without warning. One moment you’re walking with her toward a store and the next she’s stomping off, screaming at the top of her lungs. When she gets that mad, there’s no way to reason with her. It’s like watching a young girl audition for the Linda Blair role in the Exorcist. She hurls insults. She parries with guilt. She goes for the kill with dangerous theatrics.

Sunday morning, she had one of these outbursts while we were at Jerry’s Deli for breakfast. Luc made the mistake of placing his drink order before Jordan.

–Ladies first, LUC-AS!

She tried to get up and walk away, but she was blocked by me in the seating arrangement. I could not get her to sit down. Instead she started in with nastiness.

–Let go of me! Don’t touch your only daughter! You’re treating me like a baby!

Jeanette and I remained very calm. We didn’t raise our voices. We tried to hold her hand and get her attention. We knew what this anger was really about. Experts have been telling us for months that Jordan has a lot of anger towards her disease, but she vents it towards those who are closest to her. It makes sense, though it sounds a bit like psycho-babble.

But today, reality reared its head. Jordan knew that she was checking in to the hospital for treatment the next day. It had come up earlier in the conversation. Now she was exploding. And candor was unleashed for the very first time.


– I hate my body. I hate this cancer. I just want it to go away. I hate these things (kicking at her leg splints). I don’t want to wear them anymore. I’m so mad that I have to wear these. And I don’t want them to take my blood tomorrow. It’s my blood. I don’t want them to take it. I’m sick of them taking my blood. They should … put … it … back!

It was silent for a moment at the table. Jeanette and I were trying not to cry. In a way, what Jordan said was beautiful because it was just so pure. It was as if someone turned off the filter and we got to hear her thoughts as they coursed through her synapses. I held her as much as she would let me. A few minutes later Luc would divert her attention and peace would be restored, but Jeanette and I were affected for the rest of the day. Our daughter is tired, frustrated and disappointed. She wants to be a normal kid, with normal problems. She doesn’t want to live each day dreading needles and treatments. The hardest part is that there is nothing Jeanette or I can do or say to relieve this tension. Jordan is too smart. She knows what’s coming each day. Sometimes she knows before we do, because she senses changes in her body. She often tries to hide these changes from us, hoping they’ll just go away, fearful they might lead to another stay in the hospital or a more painful treatment.

It’s a heck of a kid’s life. She’s been living this way for nearly four years, and there’s no end in sight. She has no set treatment protocol. She has no prognosis. She has no milestones to mark her progress. Instead, she reports to the hospital every week to get connected to an IV and have toxic chemicals pushed into her body. This unrelenting process is taking a psychological toll.

For the most part, the rest of our Sunday was pleasant and relaxing. The kids played in the pool for hours. We ate lunch poolside and watched an Angel game on the tv in our cabana. Jordan took a nice long nap. It wasn’t until we went out for dinner that Jordan’s temper flared again. Again, it came without warning. Again, it was over something that might otherwise seem trivial. The hostess at the restaurant took us to a regular table instead of a booth. When Jordan saw the table she yelled, wheeled on her heels, and started storming toward other diners in search of the exit. When I went to stop her, she kicked me and screamed at the top of her lungs. I rushed her out of the restaurant. Outside, she tried to break free of my grip, shouting at me, lunging toward Westwood traffic.

The hostess came to us outside the restaurant to tell us she had a booth Jordan could have. We went back inside but I was fuming and ready for a drink. After a few minutes, Jordan tried to apologize, but the mood was sour all around. She knew what she did was wrong. I’m sure she knew she’d do it again. Part of me wants to overlook the bad behavior, and part of me wants to keep it in check. This child teaches me something new about adversity every day. I think this latest phase is another, perhaps more challenging lesson.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She turned nine yesterday. She bolted into our bedroom first thing in the morning, legs leaping out in front of her.<br /><br />&ndash; Do you know what today is?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&ndash;What day is it?<br /><br />Her eyes squinted off into a distant place, as though she were trying to recall a calendar page and picture it in front of her. She brushed her hair back from her face in a haphazard, distracted manner reflective of her intense concentration.<br /><br />&ndash;It&rsquo;s Sunday, sweetie.<br /><br />She was quiet for a moment, eyes locked in that far away place. Then she broke the silence with a groan.<br /><br />&ndash;Oh, I hate Mondays.<br /><br />It was hard to suppress a laugh. Sometimes I suspect that I irritate her when I laugh at thoughts she feels quite sincerely. She doesn&rsquo;t understand the irony &hellip; never heard the song by the Boomtown Rats, and probably doesn&rsquo;t understand why when I hear her say such a thing, I have to release my own anxiety by having a little chuckle. She probably _does_ hate Mondays &ndash; despises them, I would imagine &ndash; but not because Monday marks the return of school, or the end of the weekend. She hates Mondays because for 10 weeks straight, Mondays are the days when she gets poked and tested and laced with chemo. If I were her, I&rsquo;d hate Mondays, too.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />It&rsquo;s a nasty thing, this disease she negotiates. It&rsquo;s the things we don&rsquo;t see that must be most bothersome. It makes her tired. It confuses her. It saps her memory and dulls her comprehension. We compare her to Dory, the forgetful fish in Finding Nemo. She likes the comparison and enjoys clowning about with her absent-mindedness, but inside it must be very frustrating and embarrassing.<br /><br />Then, there are the headaches.<br /><br />She devours Tylenol like candy. We assumed she just liked the taste. It&rsquo;s not the Tylenol of my childhood, which came in a sticky syrup that tasted of black licorice. Children&rsquo;s Tylenol today is a &ldquo;meltaway&quot; with a tasty cherry flavor. We assumed Jordan found excuses to take it because she loves sweets. Her motives are often suspicious. She tends to want Tylenol after being denied candy. But her doctors assured us that it was not harmful to her, particularly when considering the marrow-weakening agents pumped into her veins each week.<br /><br />We recently realized that she might actually need the Tylenol. She often complains of headaches, but the symptoms are minimal compared to what we&rsquo;ve seen her endure. On a flight back from New York a couple of weeks ago, I came down with a dehydration headache. It throbbed inside my head and made me cranky. All I wanted to do was shut my eyes and be quiet. I&rsquo;m sure it paled in comparison to what she encounters every day of her life. Her doctors speak of &quot;the mass of disease&rdquo; in her head. It&rsquo;s only natural to imagine that such a mass packs a wallop of a headache.<br /><br />Jeanette and I had a sobering revelation. It was late at night. We had turned in for the evening, catching up on the day&rsquo;s events before shutting our eyes to sleep. Jordan had a very emotional day. She&rsquo;d thrown a temper tantrum, screamed at her mother and sulked through the house in a state of obstinate defiance. Her mood swings were erratic and exasperating. She later apologized to Jeanette and blamed her actions on a headache. Jeanette was thoroughly exhausted and uncertain how to handle future outbursts. We lay silently in the dark for a minute or so. I had run out of the unsolicited advice I generally administer. That&rsquo;s when the notion hit me and I blurted it out without even thinking.<br /><br />&ndash;Well, if I had a migraine headache, I&rsquo;d probably be a horrible pain in the ass, too.<br /><br />We laughed a bit, but uneasily. Jeanette gets migraines every once in awhile. When she does, she&rsquo;s very nearly incapacitated. She gets nauseous. She tells me it affects her whole body. What if that&rsquo;s how Jordan feels when the headaches come on?<br /><br />Nine year olds are temperamental creatures. As they inch their way from childhood to adolescence, it is natural for them to test parental boundaries and explore the perimeter of individual will. That&rsquo;s what being nine is all about. And it is that which makes our understanding of Jordan&rsquo;s predicament all the more difficult. When should we assume she is sincerely suffering, and when she would we suspect a bit of ninery? Sometimes, I have no doubt that her claims of bad headaches are merely a crutch to get out of cleaning her room or explain away bad behavior. But I have no more doubt that there are just as many times when what she says is exactly how she feels, and exactly an explanation of the circumstances.<br /><br />Last month, Jeanette and Jordan traveled to Portland to visit my sisters. In the security line at the airport, Jordan complained of a headache. Jeanette tried to cheer and distract her while they snaked their way through the metal detectors. Just before they exited the screening area Jordan suddenly laid down on the ground. She attempted to close her eyes. She complained of the headache again. Jeanette managed to get Jordan back on her feet and over to the gate. It was so sudden, so unnerving. Jeanette looked down to see her daughter lying still in the bustle of feet. That incident reminded us of the gravity of Jordan&rsquo;s illness. It&rsquo;s easy, and far more pleasant, to consider the surface view &ndash; to enjoy the whimsical, temperamental, strong-willed girl who is &ldquo;kicking cancer&rsquo;s butt.&quot; It&rsquo;s easy to think of her illness as an annoyance. But that viewpoint underestimates the power of her strength. We must remember that beneath the surface apparition is the body of a child waged in a war against a disease that would debilitate an adult.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-3704871012205892737?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been several weeks since I&rsquo;ve posted and I&rsquo;d prefer to say that life has kept me too busy to write. But the truth is I&rsquo;ve just kept putting it off. Life has kept the Vincent family busy and here&rsquo;s the quick update to get you back on the same page. <a id="more" name="more"></a><br /><br /><strong>In June our family expanded as we welcomed Gracie, a 4 month old pug, into the Vincent clan.</strong><br /><br /><strong>School&rsquo;s Out</strong><br /><br />Jordan graduated from first grade and Luc finished the fifth. Both of them were very happy to end the school year.<br /><br /><strong>Jordan shows her diploma</strong><br />Jordan began summer school last week. Luc passed on summer school but opted to go to &ldquo;away&rdquo; camp for the first time. He enjoyed a week at Camp Pali where he took the film director&rsquo;s track. He returned with a DVD showing off his directorial talents.<br /><br /><strong>Health Matters</strong><br /><br />Jordan finished the last dose in her new chemo cycle today. She gets a break for a couple of weeks before beginning again. The most significant new side effect is fatigue. She gets tired quickly, and when she zonks out, she sleeps hard &ndash; often napping for several hours. She looks thin to us, but she&rsquo;s actually gained weight. Other than a little nausea here and there, she&rsquo;s been very active and feeling well.<br /><br /><strong>A Dog&rsquo;s Life</strong><br /><br />We really missed having a dog in the house, but we knew that our circumstances required a special breed. Back in Illinois, my uncle Ferris breeds beautiful pugs. My sister Lisa and my parents each have dogs from his litters. They&rsquo;re wonderful with the kids and the perfect size for Jordan. So we finally called Ferris up and made arrangements to adopt one of our own. We brought Gracie home last week and she immediately fit right in. She&rsquo;s a four-month old puppy with a sweet disposition and enough spunk to keep the kids laughing.<br /><br /><strong>Girl&rsquo;s Holiday</strong><br /><br />Last week, Jordan and Jeanette travelled to Portland to visit my sisters. Jordan had been looking forward to the trip for months &ndash; a girls only excursion. I pampered them with all the might my frequent flier miles and credit cards would allow. They flew first class, had a car take them to the airport and stayed at the luxurious Westin Portland. They had a great time, but the travel took a lot out of Jordan. She showed familiar symptoms early, and of course, we know now what to look for. Just to be safe, her doctors prescribed some medication to ensure that her brain could rest while she enjoyed pedicures and museum trips. When she returned home it took her a few days to fully recover, but she sure enjoyed getting out and away.<br /><br />More to come&hellip;</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our family has a rhythm these days. We fit. The twists and turns of Jordan&rsquo;s Journey don&rsquo;t stop us from behaving like an ordinary family with ordinary highs and lows. Only once in awhile do I stop to reflect on gravity and uncertainty and cancer.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.jordanvincent.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/party_girl.jpg" alt="Jordan Party Girl" /><br /><strong>The Vincents Know How to Party</strong><br /><br />A few nights ago I stood outside my house in the backyard between the two windows of my children. I looked to the right to see Luc, squatting in his room over a textbook, fiddling with a rope in one hand and a pencil in the other. He scribbled the solution to a math problem between the non sequiturs of sailor&rsquo;s knots and cat&rsquo;s game. His wild platinum hair flashed brilliant in the fading light of the day.<br /><br />To my left, Jordan gazed trancedly at her television, propped against a pillow on her bed. Her face was relaxed in leisure, lips curling up slightly to the side, her alabaster skin flickering bluish in the glow of the program. She is so content these days, so calm, so at peace and yet full of zest.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />I have these two children &ndash; these wondrous specimens of life. I love them with all my heart. It is different for each, but no less or more in either case. And I sometimes get lost imagining what might be, what is random, what I cannot predict but often dread.<br /><br />That evening was a story in itself. It was a memento and a promise.<br /><br />When I walked through the doors, tired and ready to sit back with a book and a glass of good red wine, Jordan bounded from the hall and cheered my arrival. There was no time for reclining.<br /><br />&ndash; You&rsquo;re home! Let&rsquo;s go for a walk.<br />&ndash; Jordan, I just walked through the door. I need a few minutes.<br />&ndash; Okay, Dad. But then we walk up the hill &hellip; and eat trail mix.<br />&ndash; I need a few minutes.<br />&ndash; I&rsquo;ll go get my shoes, Dad.<br /><br />Such is the life in the girl. As I slunk into the kitchen to set my bag down, I heard her heavy steps plunging across the living room floor. I looked over to see her standing in the arch of the kitchen with her leg splints and a pair of socks in hand.<br /><br />&ndash; I&rsquo;ve got my shoes, Dad<br />&ndash; But, sweetheart, Daddy needs a few minutes to wind down.<br />&ndash; I&rsquo;ll go into the family room where we can put my shoes on.<br /><br />I appealed to Jeanette. She just smirked and shook her head. I was clearly on my own. Despite my pleadings and lame excuses, I found myself tying on my sneakers and fixing trail mix with a blonde temptress. Minutes later we were hiking up the sidewalk outside our house. This is the spirit that keeps her alive. This is the essence of Jordan.<br /><br />The evening was cool, and as we walked up the street, she mused about the ordinary and the spectacular. She munched on hazelnuts and dried cherries and spoke of grey cats in the neighborhood and orange trees in the passing yards. The hill was steep, but she forced me to break a sweat to keep up with her. She wanted to take the steeper hill in front of us, but I insisted that we turn and level off. I worried about her healing legs, and the fact that she&rsquo;d endured chemo the day before. I wanted to protect her and walk casually in the twilight at a pace that didn&rsquo;t nag me to reach out and keep her from tripping. <br /><br />&ndash; Okay, Dad. We can skip this hill, but then we&rsquo;ll do two when we get to the bottom.<br /><br />She meant this. And when we&rsquo;d rounded the block and climbed the lower hill she remarked that her knees were sore, so as our house neared I suggested that we turn in for the evening. She was instantly cross.<br /><br />&ndash; No. Let&rsquo;s climb the bigger hill.<br /><br />I cheated and put the blame on me.<br /><br />&ndash; Daddy&rsquo;s old and tired, I exclaimed.<br /><br />She dug in with her will and pride. <br /><br />&ndash; Okay, Dad. But you&rsquo;re not old. You&rsquo;re just tired. We&rsquo;ll climb the bigger one the next time.<br /><br />And with that, she reluctantly escorted me back into the house and retreated to her room. It was less that an hour later that she interrupted my glass of wine and good book to insist that I read to her from _Nancy Drew_. Again, I tried to deflect the request, but she would not be ignored and within a few minutes we were deep into River Creek. She lingered on my every word. Occasionally, I would stop to ask if she understood what happened, expecting her to make something up. But she&rsquo;d recount the story&rsquo;s events with remarkable clarity. She&rsquo;d speak with her dilated eyes staring away from me, as if the impartation required singular effort. Still, she got it, and I continued.<br /><br />When the chapter had ended, she asked me to carry her to her room. I bundled her up in a blanket and lifted her &ldquo;like a bride&rdquo;. As I lay her down, I requested a hug, and she grasped me tight around the waist with such a force that I grunted. It was a hug of determination &ndash; a statement to show how strong she was. And she is strong. And I am humbled by her strength. She has no concept of surrender &ndash; of frailty. She is a prairie girl. Midwest flows from her veins. I cannot help but think of my grandmother &ndash; a woman full of gritty strength but overflowing with love and kindness.<br /><br />When the evening was coming to an end and Jordan was tucked into her bed, I reflected on what, if anything, it all means, where it is all headed, what will happen next. And the answer to each question is &ldquo;unknown.&rdquo; She is a thing of beauty. My family is a thing of beauty. Life is beautiful &ndash; in all it&rsquo;s deranged, tragic, unfair possibilities, it exudes through the gifts and virtues of my daughter. When everything seems bleak, and I worry about how long she&rsquo;s got (knowing full well that it could be 80 years more), I revel in the simple moments: the walks with her, the stories, the munching trail mix together at sunset. And I realize, it&rsquo;s so worth the price of admission.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-8741888524250868283?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We Vincents know how to celebrate Memorial Day properly. It&rsquo;s not an All-American holiday without baseball. So Friday night we headed to Dodger stadium to watch the Dodgers play the Chicago Cubs, with dugout seats provided courtesy of one of my favorite clients.<br /><img src="http://www.jordanvincent.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/jordan_cub.jpg" alt="Jordan the Cub Fan" /><br /><strong>She&rsquo;s a Cub fan alright!</strong><br /><br />Jordan was very excited about going to a baseball game. She was excited about getting cotton candy. But mostly, she was excited to root for the Cubs. A little background is necessary. I&rsquo;m from Illinois originally. My hometown is about equal distance between Chicago and St. Louis. There&rsquo;s a civil war in my family between team allegiances. You&rsquo;re either a Cubs fan or a Cardinals fan. I&rsquo;ve always been the former, and I often watch a Cubs game on tv, sometimes with Jordan sitting on my lap. I think she&rsquo;s become a fan by osmosis. Friday was a fascinating display of brave loyalty.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />When it was time to leave for the game, I debated whether or not to wear one of my many Cubs hats or wear a Dodger hat. Truth be told, my real team loyalty lies with the Angels. I took in my first baseball game at the age of six at Angel Stadium, shortly after my family moved to Southern California. My mother became a die-hard fan and I spent many a weekend rooting for Nolan Ryan, or Doug DeCinces, or Mike Witt. I like the Dodgers, but I don&rsquo;t have any emotional attachment to the team. The trouble is that I don&rsquo;t care for baseball crowds. I&rsquo;ve been to games with my kids where fans were unruly with the visiting team fans and it just makes for an unpleasant experience. So I opted to wear my Dodger hat, blend in and enjoy the game with the family.<br /><br />That plan was foiled when I met Jordan in the living room. She was decked in Cub gear from head to toe. She borrowed a Cubs insignia baseball shirt from her brother. It was bold and proud. She topped that off with a blushing pink Cubs ladies ball cap. She took one look at my hat and gave me a grimace.<br /><br />&ldquo;How come you&rsquo;re not wearing Cubs?&rdquo;<br /><br />It was not a gentle inquiry. I tried to explain that I &ldquo;just wanted to blend in, especially because we were guests of the Dodgers.&rdquo; She glowered at me. I went back and grabbed a Cubs hat and that was that.<br /><br />As we entered Dodger stadium Jordan kept shouting &ldquo;Go, Cubs!&rdquo; as loud as she could. People turned and looked down at the little girl with the big chant and the brazen display of visiting team spirit. Fortunately for us, there are a lot of Cubs fans in LA. They cheered her on. We kept telling her to keep her voice down. Dodger fans turned to boo her, but then saw that it was a little girl and didn&rsquo;t know what to do.<br /><br />Our seats were amazing&ndash;probably the best seats I&rsquo;ve ever had at any baseball game. Four rows from the field in the Dugout Club. Larry King sat across the aisle from us with his family. We were on the home dugout side surrounded by die-hard Dodger fans. It didn&rsquo;t matter. Jordan cheered every Dodger strikeout. She rooted every time a Cubby reached. People turned around and glared at us annoyed as the Cubs took a nice three-run lead. Jordan was unabated as she nibbled on cotton candy and peanuts.<br /><br />Early on she noticed that Dodger players tossed a ball into the stands after they retired the side. Larry King would stand up and call out to a player and ask for the ball. It was usually Nomar (a former Cub, I might add). Larry would catch the ball and then toss it to a nearby kid. When Jordan saw this, she was determined to catch a ball. But she was decked in Cub gear! We told her it would be a fat chance that a Dodger would throw a Cub fan a ball. So, my crafty little girl zipped up her hoody and took off her ball cap. At the end of the sixth, she ran down to the dugout rail. We thought she had no chance. We couldn&rsquo;t hear what she was saying, but she caught the attention of the third base coach &hellip; who had the ball. The next thing we knew he was tossing it to Jordan. And she caught it. She bounced back to her seat with pride, unzipped her hoody to let the Cubs logo breathe again and put her cap back on her head.<br /><br />That&rsquo;s my daughter. It&rsquo;s pretty hard to deter her when she puts her mind to anything. That spirit was alive and well yesterday as she began her new chemo protocol. She cooperated beautifully and called me when it was done to tell me she &ldquo;did excellent!&rdquo; I asked her last night, when I tucked her in, if she was feeling tired or sick.<br /><br />&ldquo;No. I feel just fine, Dad.&rdquo;<br /><br />Then she changed the subject.<br /><br />&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it cool when I caught that ball?&rdquo;<br /><br />I told her it was. Then I asked her:<br /><br />&ldquo;What did you say to get that man to throw you the ball?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I just told him that he should throw it to me if he wanted it to go to someone strong. I told him I was kicking cancer&rsquo;s butt.&rdquo;<br /><br />I couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh and think about what that man must have thought, with this blond-haired youngster shouting out about being strong and then revealing her biggest weakness. Whatever he thought, I&rsquo;m grateful to him and proud of her.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-773559640555672495?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Menu</title>
		<link>http://jordanvincent.com/2007/05/23/the-menu/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We unfolded the single sheet of paper and handed Jordan a pen. The nurses looked on curiously. Six menu items were listed. She couldn’t read any of them, but she knew what the big rectangular box meant next to each. If she could check off each of these boxes, she’d earn a reward, and today’s reward was the DVD of <em>High School Musical</em>.<!--more-->“Can you read me the first one, Daddy?”

Before I could even start to read “lie down on the table” Jordan was climbing onto the exam table. As soon as she was prone she reached for the pen and checked the box. The IV nurse cocked her head as she put on her gloves.

Jordan handed Jeanette the pen and began unbuttoning her pajama top. Step two was to take off her shirt and peel off the bandage on her port. We read this to her, but she was ahead of us again and reached out for the pen. The nurses whispered amongst themselves. In the next room we heard the cries of another kid who was not as compliant as our little girl.

The nurse began cleaning the skin on Jordan’s chest, which was actually step 3 – let the nurse clean the port. Jordan lay still to let her finish. Check!

Not being as accustomed to this as Jeanette, I took a step back to admire my daughter as she tucked her hands behind her head. She reclined all the way. Then I looked down at the list: “Step 4: Put your hands behind your back or to the sides.” Another nurse came in to watch. The two of them, the nurses, they giggled a bit and praised Jordan for her bravery. They told her they wished other patients were as helpful.

Step 5 was easy enough, although we had to remind Jordan. Look away. Naturally, she wants to look down to see what they’re doing to her body. But the best thing for a kid to do is look away, and once we reminded her to do so, she did. The nurses moved in. Fortunately, I’m not squeamish around needles.

And then she started singing. Yes, singing. Step 6. She broke out into a lovely scat, half Ella Fitzgerald, half Disney. She sang and held my hand and only stopped for a moment on the pin prick.

“Ow!”

That was it. Then she went back to the song while the nurses dressed her port and prepped her for the MRI. As we walked over to the giant machines that would photograph her brain and spine in vivid radiologic detail, the nurse leaned in to Jeanette and I to praise our girl and compliment my wife on her brilliant way to manage Jordan’s anxiety.

Only one of us could go with Jordan into the MRI room. Jordan’s had many of these, so she has no fear of the process at all. But she still likes for me to be there when they put her out with sedation. I made sure my travel schedule complied.

She waltzed into the room, gabbed with the anesthesiologist and sang a little more, just for good measure. She wanted to climb onto the MRI table, but the docs insisted that Daddy do the honors. She smiled as she lay flat as a board on the sheet-draped gurney. In the background, the machinery whirred and chanted rhythmically. Jordan was all smiles. She chattered on about the prize she was going to enjoy when she got home. She told the docs that I called her a “sugar bug,” and a “sweet pea,” and a “snicklefritz.” The doc grinned and asked if she was always this animated. I told him she was.

I kissed her on the forehead as the white stain of the propofol creeped up her IV and entered her body. She was midsentence as its nectar took effect. Her eyes rolled back. The corners of her smile relaxed. The grip of her hand loosened. Such a simple process, and yet it still gets me every time.

She did great, of course. She never likes to wake up, but there was less drama bringing her to today than on previous occasions. And only an hour later she was chattering and singing again. She rambled on even as the oncologist came in to discuss the results. We had to keep reminding her to give us a moment. We promised her she could sing for the doctor when he was done visiting with us. She became a little cross. She just wanted to go.

For all her good deeds this day, the news would not be so rewarding. There is the slightest hint that her tumors may have increased in size. It looks as if there may be new lesions in her spine. There’s nothing dramatically different. In keeping with the crawling, vapid pace of her unique disease, the beast gave us nothing to react to. And this is indeed a blessing, though it bears an unsettling footnote. We are encouraged by her physical progress, by her mood and her boundless energy. But we are also nervous. We have not exhausted the clinical resources so there is no reason to panic or turn maudlin. She’ll begin a new chemo protocol next week, and the doctor is optimistic about its promises. We are optimistic, too. And Jordan is perfectly willing to earn more rewards for checking off her menu.<img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-7973320562158861352?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thread #1: I sit on our patio, clacking away on my laptop. The French doors are open giving me a panoramic view of our living room, which sits behind a perfectly framed proscenium for Jordan. It&rsquo;s a Friday. A little house music back-beats in the background. I look up from the phosphorescent glow of my screen to see Jordan sashay across the floor. She&rsquo;s not even looking at me. Her head is tilted balletically, arms extended, rhythm coursing. The drop-foot gait accents each step, but she dances across and out of sight. I think she&rsquo;s headed toward the kitchen. I chuckle a few minutes later when she dances across the other way. She&rsquo;s off stage when the acknowledgment comes &hellip; &ldquo;well, hello, Dad.&rdquo;<br /><br />Thread #2: It&rsquo;s early morning and I&rsquo;m again clacking away on my laptop answering emails. The sun hasn&rsquo;t peaked out yet. I get on the phone and call an east coast colleague to discuss something too irrelevant to remember. Mid-sentence, I look up across the kitchen to see Jordan slinking into view in her flannel pajamas, hair mussed, cheeks pink. She rubs her eyes and fixes me in her survey of the room. I put my finger to my lips to remind her that Daddy&rsquo;s on a call. She leans against the door frame like some 1940&rsquo;s ingénue. She waits patiently &ndash; takes a moment to rifle through the pantry &ndash; then stands on the fringes. When I hang up, the most beautiful phrase greets me. &ldquo;Well, hello, Dad.&rdquo;<br /><br />Thread #3: I sit in the family room pecking away on my laptop (sensing a theme?) I hear the heavy footsteps of the girl but keep my head down. She bursts into the room right past me, sights focused on our fluffy cat. We sometimes refer to Charlie as Jordan&rsquo;s little brother. She pounces on him. He runs for cover. She torments. &ldquo;Charlie, you know you want a big hug.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s already in another room. She rolls over and wiggles on the carpet. Without looking at me, &ldquo;well, hello, Dad.&rdquo;</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-8265113635637642411?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know a girl in Pasadena. She&rsquo;s got a streak of Ethel Merman in her. Anything you can do she can do better. Nothing stops her. You might slow her down, but you won&rsquo;t keep her from doing that which she wants. Big, hairy monsters have tried to stop this one. Big monsters with scary names like &ldquo;cancer,&rdquo; and &ldquo;tumor,&rdquo; and &ldquo;chemo&rdquo;. She pays them no mind.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.jordanvincent.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/jordan_ropebridge_small.jpg" alt="Jordan on the Rope Bridge" /><br /><br />Saturday was Lucas&rsquo;s school carnival. It was the five-star community event with plenty of physical distractions: bounce houses, bungee runs, obstacle courses. Jordan wanted to do them all. And she did. This picture was taken on the rope bridge. Jeanette and I have blood marks on our lips. There was no need for such anxiety. Jordan did anything the other kids could do. Anything.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-8603307665380531293?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The brown-haired boy followed her with his puckish brown eyes as she entered the room. In his tiny six-year-old frame he mustered a dose of full-grown Latin charm. He squashed traces of fear with daring, macho bravado and masculine charisma.

“I’m not sick,” he asserted.

As she climbed into her out-patient bed next to him Jordan grinned wide with her own brand of pride and charm.

“Me, neither,” she replied. “I’m kicking cancer’s butt!”<a name="more"></a>

Another cycle of chemo is coming to an end. It’s week #4, which means she’ll have four weeks to rest and forget about needles, blood counts and IV canisters. And since she has completed her physical therapy, she won’t have to go to the hospital at all until she begins her next chemo cycle in May.

I’m superstitious so I won’t say she’s doing well. I’ll only say that no news is good news … and I haven’t posted here for a very long time.

She is back to school and we feel very blessed about where she ended up. She now attends the Sierra Madre school just a few blocks from our home. She’s in a blended first grade class, doing all the things the kids without cancer do. It was not easy transitioning from being home with mom every day back to a structured day of learning. But she’s coming along and making great progress.

Physically, it’s astonishing what she can do. She attends ballet class every week. She can point and wiggle her toes, which some doctors thought might never happen. She still can’t flex her foot, but seeing those toes wiggle is joy enough for me. She wants to take up tennis again. And when the kids presented me with a snowboard for my birthday last week Jordan declared that she wants to learn to ski next year when the family takes its winter holiday.

Emotionally, she’s as balanced today as she was four years ago. She doesn’t linger on her illness. Sometimes, I think she wears it as a badge of honor – a sign of her strength and gusto. The doctors have reduced the dosage on some of her anti-seizure medications, which resulted in some moodiness. But Jeanette reminded me that Jordan was moody when she was only a few months old. This behavior change is actually a return to normal.

What strikes me most about Jordan these days is her compassion for others. Perhaps it’s because we’re more aware of it, or perhaps there’s a rise in incidence, but we know many friends and family members who have recently taken their own steps on a cancer journey. And every time Jordan learns about someone close who is also fighting the disease, her thoughts and prayers turn to them. I’ve never heard her pray for help towards her own cause. She only thanks God for helping her be strong. But she often prays for Him to help others with the disease. It’s fascinating to watch her act as an ambassador or advocate.

Last week I enjoyed time at home … off the road for a change. Most nights Jordan and I would snuggle up on the couch in the evening and read from Harry Potter. She listens carefully and often squeals when Hermione does something valiant. One night, when one of the characters said something about Harry’s scar, Jordan stopped me from reading.

“Harry has a scar like me.”

“Yes. He does. That’s from where someone tried to kill him.”

“Just like cancer tries to kill me.”

I didn’t know how to react to this. In all our discussions about disease, we never speak of death. It’s not that we don’t want her to consider the possibilities of her illness, because she does. When her friend Jenna passed she became all too aware of the potential consequences. We don’t speak of death because it isn’t a subject that ever surfaces. Jordan revels in her body's ability to heal, not in the deficiencies caused by cancer.

I thought for a moment–tried to think of something appropriate to say without sounding trite or patronizing. Then I fell back on the time-tested approach: ask a question.

“What happened to Harry?”

“He got stronger. Just like me.”

It&rsquo;s been about three months, and it&rsquo;s time to see if we&rsquo;re making progress. It&rsquo;s time to look in on the disease.<br />We&rsquo;re all a bit jumpy. These procedures have become so routine that we often take the results for granted. But I found myself unable to think of much else today, and Jordan is preoccupied with the minor details. She keeps reminding me of the appointment tomorrow, and insists again and again that I hold her hand until she falls asleep (which I always do when I go along).<br />Jeanette and I have trained ourselves to focus on the day at hand. Anticipating the troubles the future might bring yields little benefit. But days like tomorrow remind us of the oft-forgotten gravity in Jordan&rsquo;s life. It pricks us till our skin is raw, and rushes our adrenaline emotion.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-7076592929503948053?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

I had been slicing an apple for us to enjoy with a chunk of blue cheese and some toast, but when she changed the subject from coloring books to life, I gave her my full attention.<br />&ldquo;What&rsquo;s living?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;This blue cheese is living.&rdquo;<br />I agreed with her and told her again how cheese changes every day, just like wine, because it contains bacteria that grows and gives it delicious flavor. She nodded, but then added.<br />&ldquo;Yeah. But this IS living.&rdquo;<br />She generously coated an apple slice with the cheese, but before biting into it, she crumbled off a bit of the cheese alone and savored it. She dissolved into a mild ecstasy of the palette in a dramatic flourish that can only be regarded as Jordan&rsquo;s signature.<br />A few minutes later she wandered off, leaving me alone to my snack and a bit of reflection. She was right, of course. A good cheese is living.<a name="more"></a><br />We have a big week ahead. On Wednesday she goes in for an MRI. The doctors want to do a full review of her progress. They plan to compare the scans from this session with those from when she was first diagnosed. Our goal is to gauge the effectiveness of the chemotherapy and determine our game plan. We are a bit apprehensive, as we always are when she is about to scan in. But we try not to think too much about it. We take it one day at a time, and enjoy the pleasures of cheese in between.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-5144072643884598375?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

Jordan wouldn&rsquo;t have known. She busily fingered display items on the lip gloss counter.<br />She was so good for her grandparents while we were away that we offered her a chance to window shop at one of her favorite stores. She loves to &ldquo;girl it up,&rdquo; and Sephora is just the place she loves to indulge her girliest fancies.<br />When at last she had sampled her fill, and added several entries to her wish book, she proclaimed to the entire store, &ldquo;the movie star is going home.&rdquo;<br />And off we went.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-7562630231588935994?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

This morning she asked her mom about it. She wanted to know what questions she might be asked. Jeanette helped her recall her experiences. <br />Sometimes, Jordan&rsquo;s memory is fuzzy. For instance, when we asked her about her first symptoms, she recalls losing power in her legs. We reminded her that she was symptomatic much earlier than that. We asker her if she remembered when she got the headaches so bad, or when she had trouble remembering things at school.<br />She squinted her eyes and thought for a minute, then shook her head.<br />It&rsquo;s okay, we told her. &ldquo;We can remember that part for you.&rdquo;</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-3369619361192651307?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

She&rsquo;s growing up in every way. It&rsquo;s wonderful to watch her blossom, especially given all that she&rsquo;s overcome. Cancer hasn&rsquo;t stopped her. And as she becomes a young lady, I revel in her accomplishments while waxing nostalgically about her earlier years.

I trek to a hotel. Do a meeting. Grab a meal. Board another plane. Then I come home. And waiting for me is this little angel with a devilish spirit. She&rsquo;s the first to grab me around the waist and exclaim how much she missed me. She never lets me catch a breath. Still holding my bags, standing in the doorway, she plots an agenda for us. She croons about how glad she is that I&rsquo;m home.<br />The same day, she has endured a dose of chemo and practiced her physical therapy. I gripe and sulk about sitting on a plane in the dry, dry air at 35,000 feet. She seldom gripes about fighting for her life.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-3752029007947804199?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;Dad, may I have a taste of your wine?&rdquo;<br /><br />I look up to see her blue eyes casting down on me, head cocked and a wide smile across her face. Her right arm is slung over my neck. She tilts on her hips, balancing her weight on one leg. Her fingers scratch my neck coyly.<br /><br />I take a moment to adjust. I&rsquo;ve been absorbed on the web. It takes me a moment to process her words and shift back to Daddy mode.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />We&rsquo;ve always allowed the kids to taste our wine. It&rsquo;s a theory we embrace. If they&rsquo;re allowed to enjoy the beauty of wine when they&rsquo;re young, it won&rsquo;t be taboo, and they&rsquo;ll be less likely to binge and overdo it when they get older. It&rsquo;s untested, but it&rsquo;s our philosophy. Luc can&rsquo;t stand the taste of wine. Jordan has always loved it. LOVED it. She loves it so much that when she began chemotherapy we actually asked the doctor if it was ok for her to have a taste here and there. Her doc is a Brit, with a liberal mind, and he told her he thought it would be smashing for her to have a nip here and there.<br /><br />I have just poured myself a glass of the Alpha Omega Cabernet Sauvignon. It&rsquo;s a young wine, but big, bold and sultry. I&rsquo;ve only had my first sip, but I can tell it&rsquo;s going to be a warm afternoon.<br /><br />&ldquo;Yes, Jordan, you may have a sip. But you have to smell it first.&rdquo;<br /><br />She picks up the glass, swirls the liquid like we&rsquo;ve taught her. She holds it to the light and with great pretense exclaims, &ldquo;the color is like red roses.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not sure she&rsquo;s actually taken the time to make that observation. She&rsquo;s fond of making sweeping statements when she tastes. I stop her and ask her to look at it a little closer. What color in her crayon box does it remind her of?<br /><br />&ldquo;Well &hellip; it looks a little purple,&rdquo; she says.<br /><br />I nod and she swirls the wine some more. Then she puts her nose in the glass to give it a sniff. But she rushes this step, too &ndash; and jumps into more poetry.<br /><br />&ldquo;Oh, Dad. This smells like a beautiful flower. Like a lovely, bloomy rose.&rdquo;<br /><br />Again, I push back on her palette.<br /><br />&ldquo;Does it smell like a rose,&rdquo; I ask. &ldquo;Are you sure? Smell it again.&rdquo;<br /><br />This time she shoves her nose in the glass for a few seconds and inhales loudly. She closes her eyes and then gives me her assessment.<br /><br />&ldquo;It smells like a great morning. Like when you make us pancakes and we listen to Ella.&rdquo;<br /><br />I chuckle and tell her she&rsquo;s a poet. Then I ask her to think of smells she knows. Does this smell like cinnamon? How about vanilla? Her fingers tap my shoulder as she thinks about each. Then she takes another sniff and then a generous sip.<br /><br />I watch her adoringly. She closes her eyes again. The corners of her mouth turn upward as she enjoys the bouquet of the wine. Jeanette has told me that Jordan always volunteers to take the wine at communion at church. She never takes baby sips. The girl likes wine. But she&rsquo;s always judicious. This isn&rsquo;t a joyride. It&rsquo;s something she savors. She rarely asks for more. One sip is enough. But that sip makes her so happy. Her eyes peek open and she gives me her analysis.<br /><br />&ldquo;That <em>is</em> a good wine, Dad. It tastes like berries &hellip; berries with chocolate.&rdquo;<br /><br />I prod her on.<br /><br />&ldquo;Are they strawberries, blackberries or blueberries.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Silly Dad. You know I don&rsquo;t like blueberries.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Then what did you taste?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Strawberries.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Bitter strawberries or sweet strawberries.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;A little bitter. But it was good.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;<br /><br />She leans over and kisses me on the cheek.<br /><br />&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t give you sugar yet today,&rdquo; she charms.<br /><br />Then she scurries off, skipping awkwardly with her turned-in gait. Her terry cloth sundress flutters about her knees and clings to them like the wisps of a dandelion in the wind as she chassés to her room. I watch as she disappears. It&rsquo;s my turn to drink. I smell the nose again. And I think to myself, &ldquo;it does smell like those breakfasts together. It does remind me of a brilliant morning. I can actually hear Ella Fitzgerald.&rdquo; I sip again and close my own eyes, and I think of my girl. What a vision! What a pairing!</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-3652790502703410714?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It was our first day on the slopes. We scheduled a private lesson for Jeanette and Jordan. It was hard to contain Jordan’s excitement. She chattered constantly and told every stranger that this was her first day snowboarding.&nbsp;
<a name="more"></a>
The outfitting took longer than expected and Jordan was not pleased with the uniform selection of grey boots. She wanted pink or magenta. But she settled for grey. We weren’t able to make her leg splints fit into the boots, so she went out without them, which was just fine by her. She’s walking around pretty well these days, though she is prone to sudden falls and her gait is an awkward hobble.

During the outfitting, Jordan first met Isa, her instructor for the day. She was a great fit for Jordan – outgoing, gentle and extremely patient. She helped Jordan get into her boots and soon she and the girls were on their way up to the training camp while Luc and I headed to the top of the mountain to test the great Beaver Creek powder.
As we finished our first run, we spied the girls in training camp, and made our way over to watch. Jordan was off her board and climbing a giant snow drift. Her instructor was following. I asked the inevitable question and was told that Jordan was taking a break to make a “slip and slide.”

Jordan had actually completed her first small run down the training hill. Unlike many first-time snowboarders, she had no fear of the motion. She started moving and wanted to keep going. But an equally important part of snowboarding is learning how to stop. Jordan wasn’t interested in that part. She got frustrated and then distracted, and next thing you know, she’s climbing snow drifts.

When she found her way back down, I asked if I could watch her snowboard.

“Sure thing, Dad.”

And like that, she was on the carpet lift and making her way to the top. She strapped in and was ready to go. Isa stood close by and gave her tips. Jordan flared up and demanded to be left alone. Isa was so patient with her and never flinched in Jordan’s outburst. She explained that it was really important that she learn how to move her board across the fall line, not just down it. By that time, I was at the top of the hill. After scolding Jordan for yelling at her instructor, I encouraged her to listen and try.

It was pretty amazing to watch Jordan stand up and start going. As usual, she has no fear. And she LOVES speed. She was moving instantly, but we had to intervene lest she start bombing down the mountain without any way to stop or control her trajectory.

At the base, I congratulated her on her courage and strength. I could tell she was tired. We watched as Jeanette made her way down the hill with the instructor. On Luc’s suggestion, we put Jordan on the skiers training hill, which was nearly flat.  She was so proud to be moving by herself without help. When she finished, she was ready to call it a day. The girls gathered up their gear and headed toward the gondolas back. Luc and I took the fun way. As I dropped on to the main run, I looked up and saw the girls waving to me from the gondola. Jordan was all toothy-smile.

Mark another one off for the adventurous Jordan Vincent.]]></content:encoded>

Jordan couldn&rsquo;t wait to go out and play in the snow. Within the first 10 minutes of her frolicking she managed to make a snow angel, bean her brother with snowballs, build a &ldquo;girl fort&rdquo; and roll around in it for awhile. She&rsquo;s having a blast.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />This afternoon we borrowed sleds from the front desk and tackled a small hill. Jordan went further and with more speed than any of us. I suspect a big reason is her slight frame and light weight &ndash; but she took great pride in her accomplishments. The sledding outing ended in a giant snowball war. I accidentally beaned Jordan in the face. I was convinced this would start a melt-down. She looked at me with a stunned expression for about a second, then it turned to a smile and even faster, a &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you back for that&rdquo; grimace. She did get me back. I should mention that she has a very strong throwing arm. Surprisingly good aim!<br />Tomorrow she has a private lesson with a snowboard instructor. She&rsquo;s really looking forward to it, although she confessed to me this morning, &ldquo;sometimes it freaks me out.&rdquo;</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-7479011579377973988?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

Though I haven&rsquo;t posted for some time, rest assured. She is buoyant, industrious and sometimes charming. We&rsquo;ve been celebrating her new-found dedication to school. Over the last few weeks, she&rsquo;s attended nearly every day and made it through day far more often than usual. She&rsquo;s proud of this accomplishment.<br />She enjoyed a two-week break from chemo, but tomorrow she&rsquo;ll start again&ndash;with customary resolve and annoyance.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-3060528771664803727?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

She&rsquo;s heard us whisper about it, exchange knowing glances, even openly discuss the process by which it challenges her as she goes about being a kid. But yesterday, for the first time, Jordan saw the disease with her own eyes. Staring into the luminescent glow of the computer screen, she smiled a little. Her eyes studied the peculiar topography of her brain and the deceptively non-threatening blurs of white that marked the fringes of the tumor.<br /><br />&ldquo;You were right, Dad,&rdquo; she said with a hint of pride. &ldquo;This is interesting.&rdquo;<a name="more"></a><br /><br />Jordan has had so many MRIs of her brain and spine that Jeanette and I have lost count. It&rsquo;s a two-hour process that requires anesthesia in order to keep her very still. Jordan has rarely had much interest in the results. She&rsquo;s generally more concerned about getting accessed and fasting hours in advance of the process. This time was different. It started about a month ago when she and I sat down to record a new &ldquo;podcast&rdquo;:http://www.jordanvincent.com/?p=200. During my interview with her she mentioned that she had an MRI coming up. I asked her why the doctors ordered an MRI and she said, &ldquo;so they can see my cancer.&rdquo; I asked if she had ever seen the pictures of her cancer. She paused briefly and then, in a voice that piqued with new-found curiosity, she replied, &ldquo;No. But I would like to see those pictures.&rdquo;<br /><br />On her last visit with the oncologist, as she was heading out the door, she revisited the issue and made her request. He applauded her interest and made the arrangements for our family to get a disk of all the images.<br /><br />I wasn&rsquo;t sure how Jordan would handle this experience. She&rsquo;s so brave. Few things we imagine will disturb her actually do. Benign things in life, like moths flittering in the corner of her room, are the traumas that send her into a panic. But she&rsquo;s never had to really look at her disease before. It was always an abstraction. She knew it only through its side effects. Today, she would be looking at it as more than a shadow.<br /><br />Perhaps more interesting than her casual acceptance of the data was the way in which she handled the entire experience. Jordan grows more mature every day, and with that maturity comes the self-realization that she&rsquo;s battling something serious and challenging. When she was younger, she behaved as if cancer was as common as a cold. Today, she is slowly realizing that it is life-threatening. A year ago, a friend she met at Children&rsquo;s Hospital lost her battle with cancer. Without any prompting, Jordan prayed for her comrade at dinner on almost the exact day of the anniversary of her death. For the first time in her life, she links the cause and effect. We think she thinks about it a lot, but true to her personality, she doesn&rsquo;t let the thoughts slow her down. Instead, she chatters about the disease more frequently, and at times she releases her anxiety in ways that demonstrate her new-found maturity.<br /><br />Minutes before she was to start the MRI, when the nurse needed to access Jordan&rsquo;s port and connect the IV, Jordan asked for a minute. The nurse backed away and Jeanette gave Jordan space. Jordan rolled over and put her face in the pillow. Then she screamed, her shoulders hunching with the might of it, then relaxing gently. She rolled back over and signaled she was ready. Jeanette stopped the nurse.<br /><br />&ldquo;That was very good. I&rsquo;ll bet it felt good. Would you like to do it again?&rdquo;<br /><br />Jordan looked up, smiled and nodded. Then she rolled over and soaked the pillow with another hearty scream. When it was done, she looked away and let the nurse connect her. It wasn&rsquo;t long after that the milky white anesthetic crept up the IV tube and Jordan relaxed her grip on her mother&rsquo;s hand. She would spend the next two hours asleep in a cold metal tube. When she awoke, she would come face to face with the specter that made her scream in the first place. And she would take another step with a little less mystery.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-235387058814959700?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

Jordan acted coy about it all at first, but within 15 minutes she was parading around with the Aunt who refers to her as &ldquo;mini me.&rdquo; There is an awful lot of similarities between the two. It was a good way to end the weekend.</p><br /><br />Jordan is doing well. The new chemo drugs seem to make her more nauseous, but she won&rsquo;t be doing them as often. She gets a break from the IV this week.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-7215809711476506090?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

Jordan&rsquo;s story is blended with crescendos and quiet passages. During the most turbulent times the words pour out of me in my mind&rsquo;s effort to vent, cope and adapt. But during the tranquil moments I struggle to express the emotions. They are no less profound, just harder to express. As I watch Jordan orchestrate her life I am most often silent, introspective and humbled.<br />Tomorrow she begins chemotherapy again. It is a new protocol &ndash; actually a mixture of new and old drugs. She will need to go to the hospital less because half of the protocol uses oral meds. I thought she would be happy about this, but then I forgot that she hates pills. She heaved a heavy sigh, then threw her arms into the air. &ldquo;Well, I guess I&rsquo;ll have to start eating apple sauce again.&rdquo; It was a reference to her penchant for mixing bits of pills into the fruity snack.<a name="more"></a><br />Jordan has grown very spiritual. She prays. She thumbs through the bible. She likes going to church. She asks questions about god. It makes me very uncomfortable. I am neither religious nor spiritual. When I go to church it&rsquo;s usually because there&rsquo;s a good speaker. Our church is perhaps the most liberal in America (it nearly lost its tax exemption in the 2004 election), and it attracts wonderful thinkers and activists. That&rsquo;s the draw for me. But for Jordan, the attraction is rooted in beliefs. She believes that god listens to her, thinks about her, heals her.<br />It makes me uncomfortable because I don&rsquo;t know what to say when she talks of these things. I would never challenge her beliefs. They give her hope. She has faith, a wonderful, healing quality. On the other hand, I am leery that her spirituality will alter her tremendous self reliance. She has a beautiful independent will. I&rsquo;ve seen it in action. She has overcome the most trying physical challenges by willing the goals into realities. My remarkable daughter is a cancer survivor five years in the making because of her tremendous sense of self. She believes she can do anything, and she has. I am unapologetically stingy with the Lord. In my head, He had nothing to do with her success. But in Jordan&rsquo;s head, He guided her here. The whole conversation makes me squirmy.<br />Yet, Jordan&rsquo;s spirituality is another sign of her growing maturity. As childlike as she often is, a strong woman is growing inside. She is wont to engage in profound meditation. She relishes the opportunity to behave with sophistication, grace and elegance. Whether it&rsquo;s correcting her family when they refer to the lady&rsquo;s room as the &lsquo;bathroom&rsquo; or preparing herself for another day, she embraces life with the refinement of a young lady. She&rsquo;s a trail blazer, make no doubt. But she&rsquo;s more complex than the maverick persona she sometimes entertains. What a pool of thought must circle in her head! She certainly inspires many in mine. And though they don&rsquo;t always spring to life in printed words, they quiet me when I&rsquo;m lost in triviality and burdened by occupation.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-2594147108954276268?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

She reminded us nearly every day in the months leading up to her birthday in August. When it  arrived, we didn&rsquo;t have to think very hard about what to get her. She says her phone is one of the best gifts she&rsquo;s ever received. She connects with her friends and family every day.</p> <a name="more"></a><br />&ndash; Jordan, who are you talking to?<br />&ndash; Grandma.<br />&ndash; It&rsquo;s 6:30 in the morning!<br />&ndash; That&rsquo;s ok, Dad. She&rsquo;s an early bird like us.<br />&ndash; Jordan, that&rsquo;s too early to call people.<br />&ndash; Dad, I&rsquo;m on the phone.<br />This is how it goes now. But there are plentiful benefits. Nearly every day she calls me at work. I don&rsquo;t carry my phone around with me much, so I return to my desk to find new voice mails from her. They are breathy, and affectionate, and absolutely sincere. She practices her own phone protocol, which usually includes a moment of song. She called me yesterday and sang a few bars from <em>Hernando&rsquo;s Hideaway</em>. In the background, I could hear Luc admonishing her.<br />&ndash; Jordan, that&rsquo;s too long of a message.<br />&ndash; (in song) I know &hellip; a dark &hellip; secluded place &hellip;<br />&ndash; JORDAN!<br />&ndash; (still in key) a place &hellip; where no &hellip; one knows your face<br />My voice mail box is reaching capacity because I refuse to delete these little love mails. She sprinkles each with poignant observations and heartfelt salutations. Her optimism and charm gush through, and even my worst day feels bright when I listen to these. Many of our friends and family have received their own doses. Which makes me think that perhaps this really is the best gift I&rsquo;ve ever given.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-1218988228226600383?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jordan&rsquo;s MRI showed stable results. Her medical team is starting a protocol that will introduce a new drug while alternating with the current drugs. It could mean that she only has to go in for intravenous therapy every other week, which will make her very happy. The new protocol has been achieving great results with other brain tumor patients, so her doctor is optimistic that this will be another step forward for Jordan.<br />Other than that, the kids have been busy getting back into the school groove. Jordan is very excited about starting 3rd grade &hellip; and the return of the football season.<br />A lengthier update is on the way&hellip;</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-4190203347984859374?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes I think she has multiple personalities. She&rsquo;s fodder for a potential after school special (how I loved those when I was 13). She actually walked up to me today and told me that she wasn&rsquo;t Jordan. She was Jordansina. I nodded, looked wary, and attempted a smile.<br /><br />&ndash; How are you, Jordan&rsquo;s daddy? (she actually called me that)<br /><br />&ndash; I&rsquo;m ok &hellip; Jordansina. Where is Jordan?<br /><br />&ndash; Oh, she&rsquo;s cleaning her room. She&rsquo;s been very bad. I told her to do her chores.<br /><br />&ndash; What are your chores?<br /><br />&ndash; I don&rsquo;t have any. I&rsquo;m a princess.<br /><br />And with this, she wheeled around and sauntered off, twisting her hips to the side with each step and a flexed hand in the air.<br /><br />Every once in awhile, we ask her to clean up after herself. She left an exercise mat in the living room. We asked her to roll it up and put it away. She tried wooing us with a coy smile &ndash; as Jordansina. We insisted. Without skipping a beat she turned on her heels and stomped off, hips again swinging wildly.<br /><br />&ndash; Don&rsquo;t ask me to do that!<br /><br />We stared at one another. Then Jeanette added:<br /><br />&ndash; This is how it always is.<br /><br />She&rsquo;s a stir fry of emotion at times, but she&rsquo;s doing well, otherwise.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-5444179398619652278?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

She had been waiting for me. Birthday dinners out are a sacred tradition in our house. The celebrant can select any restaurant they fancy. Jordan&rsquo;s first choice was sushi, but &hellip; a girl on chemo can&rsquo;t take too many chances, so we talked her out of it. Second choice: El Chollo.<br />I should describe the birthday girl who greeted me. Pink, floral print dress with plenty of poof and a large silk flower at the waist line. A pink under shirt. Light pink tights capped by black felt shoes with magenta satin trim. A sporty purple reticule draped across her shoulder nearly matched her purple cats eye glasses frames. She looked like a fashion designer who was on a pink exploration while in town from New York for only a day.<br />She had a lovely birthday. We ate. We sang. We toasted her health and the 10 years of joy she&rsquo;s brought to the world.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-1608957411581522925?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe. A decade. She&rsquo;s bigger than life and has been from the day she first thrilled the air with the electricity of her hearty cry. I still remember that day, and the way her perfect face stared back at me in the white light of the delivery room. My little girl will be ten on Wednesday. Her decennial achievement is all the more special because of what she has achieved in that time.<br /><br />She&rsquo;s healthy. Her doctors are pleased with her progress. They waxed metaphorical on her last visit, looking over her MRI scans from May and comparing them to scans from two years ago. Progress is being made. And the best proof is the girl herself, who stumbles gracefully into adolescence; who taxes charmingly into self-reliance; and who reminds us every day that life is ripe and bellicose and uplifting and deflating all at once, and all in all. Through it all the scent of existence lingers and promises rewards with every trial.<br /><br />On Wednesday, she&rsquo;ll sit at the head of the table as we feast on El Chollo. She plans to eat her fill of green corn tamales, and I plan to lift my glass to her and celebrate everything about her &ndash; her tempestuousness, her blushing wit, her beauty, her intellect, and most of all, her resilience.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-5207465470185270252?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

She likes how I make her laugh, and I like how she just hangs with me. We both like to travel and we enjoy sophomoric humor. Oh, and we both appreciate the finer things in life. My daughter is a clever companion and a trying child. Someday, I hope she does things in a certain way because of my influence. I know I will look at the world forever through a different lens because of her.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-6386649674082855840?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

They&rsquo;ve been through so much together, and while each knows how to push the other&rsquo;s buttons, they ebb and flow together like kindred souls. As Jordan grows ever more mature, transforming into a graceful young woman, I enjoy watching her take quiet comfort in the company of her mother.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-6300262051784825150?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

It&rsquo;s wonderful! This weekend we bunked in the same room. Jeanette and Jordan slept in one bed, I slept in the other&hellip;with the dog. I would wake up first, just as the sun was rising. I&rsquo;d smack my lips a bit, roll over and rub my eyes. As they came into focus, I&rsquo;d look over at the other bed. Jeanette would be crashed out, unwakeable. But no sooner than I looked over would I see my daughter rubbing her eyes and stirring in the bed. A few minutes later,  the two of us would head out to breakfast. We&rsquo;re the early risers in the family. We take a kind of pride in it. And it makes for great breakfast conversations &ndash; just the two of us, feeding our faces and sharing our dreams.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-2812255406053185453?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

She is doing so much better in her studies. For the first time in years she is able to recall the lyrics to songs and recognize letter forms. She wants to read so badly, and she works at it every day. When she doesn&rsquo;t speak of school and reading she waxes on about going to Paris, which we plan to do in 2009. She idles over unpleasantries, like getting accessed each Monday for chemo and doing physical therapy. Instead, she saves her energy to run through the sprinklers, or have a story read to her, or visit with friends. In short, she focuses on being a kid &ndash; exactly as we want her to.<br />Yesterday she came to me filled with a melancholy expression. When I asked her what was wrong she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s happening so fast.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;What?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m growing up.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;We all grow up, honey. That&rsquo;s nothing to make you sad.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I like being a kid.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still a kid. And you&rsquo;ll be a kid for awhile.&rdquo;<br />She thought about it for a few minutes, running her finger up and down her arm as she gazed off to an unfixed place. Then she looked at me with those cool blue eyes.<br />&ldquo;No matter what, I&rsquo;ll always be your baby.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Yes, you will.&rdquo;</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-5157350381656360164?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We ride together in my Jeep. She sits shotgun. The stereo blasts 70&rsquo;s classics, most of which we ignore as ambient background. She chatters incessantly; something about a trip to the mall, then on to a peacock named Barney.<br /><br />The music changes and we hear the first tinkling chords of Dennis DeYoung&rsquo;s piano on Styx&rsquo;s &ldquo;Come Sail Away.&rdquo; Jordan cocks her head and ponders the descant for a moment. She tells me how much she likes the piano playing. I adjust the volume, partly to reconnect with my youth and (honestly) partly to drown out her monologue. It is to no avail. When DeYoung&rsquo;s vocal begins, she speaks loud enough to compete with the music.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />&ldquo;What a beautiful voice.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfect. It could be a boy or a girl.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;No, honey. It&rsquo;s a boy.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;But it could be a girl.&rdquo;<br /><br />The music twists and edges toward rock. Jordan begins tapping her feet on the floorboard.<br /><br />&ldquo;I like this beat.&rdquo;<br /><br />It is a beautiful Southern California day, and the sun beams through the sunroof. The tempo of the music and the tapping of her feet strike me and I start singing along. Jordan plays air guitar. And then, finally, the refrain. Together, the two of us battle the speakers, rolling our way up the foothills to our home.<br /><br />&ldquo;Come sail away. Come sail away. Come sail away with me.&rdquo;<br /><br />We continue on this way, singing together, rocking out. It feels good. I feel alive and she is smiling. When it is done, we nod to one another and give a light high five.<br /><br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fun to sing with your family,&rdquo; she says.<br /><br />I agree and we back into the drive. She grabs me around the waist as we enter the house, and I cradle her head, stroking her soft hair. She thanks me. I don&rsquo;t ask why. Tomorrow she goes back for chemo to continue her fight against the disease. We are all emboldened by her recent success&ndash;grateful to be able to turn our attention to car-ride song and indulgence in classic rock.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-5702666711767395964?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

Occasionally, she&rsquo;d cock her mouth sideways to smile playfully, knowing the response she&rsquo;d receive from her audience. The acclaim continues to pour in. With each new accolade she   is the more imperturbable. She has a charming poise, a certain manner as if to say, &ldquo;of course, I&rsquo;m kicking its butt!&rdquo;<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Despite the fabulous news, Wednesday was a long, exhausting today. We&rsquo;ve learned to prepare ourselves emotionally. It&rsquo;s difficult to lift Jordan&rsquo;s spirits when she is fasting because she&rsquo;s about to undergo anesthesia. She was in a very cooperative mood Wednesday morning, though. She engaged the nurses and the anesthesiologist with wit and casual conversation. She gave them no trouble when it was time to get accessed. And as she slipped into slumber on the table of the MRI, she only half-finished an enthusiastic treatise on the joy of sushi.<br />By the time Jordan awoke and had lunch, the real anxiety set in. She wanted to go home and we wanted to know what the doctors saw. We&rsquo;ve grown accustomed to non-news &ndash; the usual speech about very little change, maybe slight growth, maybe a slight reduction. We often hear that her tumor is &lsquo;stable.&rsquo; And we believed this was what we were to hear again, until her doctor came into the room.<br />Her doctor is an optimist in every sense. He is a perfect fit for Jordan because he measures every diagnosis by the possibilities available for treatment. He often says he has a plan D and E already at work in his mind, just in case. When the news is not good, he delivers it warmly and with hope. Wednesday, he was positively effusive.<br />&ldquo;Well, my little one, do you want to know about the great pictures I just saw?&rdquo;<br />Jordan ignored him slightly. She fidgets in the exam room, often singing nervously and pretending no one else is with her.<br />He looked to us and told us that he was shocked at how well she was doing. He said he even checked the film again to make sure he was looking at the right patient and the right scan date. He pulled his interns over and showed them. The difference between her last scan and this day was dramatic. The enhancements marking the boundary of the tumor encircling Jordan&rsquo;s brain were dimmer and less pronounced on the scans. Make no mistake, there is still a large mass of disease, but today it is less than it was three months earlier.<br />The visual diagnosis fits beautifully with the behavioral observations. In the last month Jordan has been more lively. Her cognitive abilities are flourishing. She is doing better at letter recognition. She remembers the entire lyrics to songs. She links experiences and knowledge together fluidly and with quick delivery.<br />After meeting with the doctor, Jeanette and I had little to say. We had prepared to ask many questions, all of them connected to an adverse diagnosis. We should have been hopping up and down in celebration. But we were subdued instead. We hugged each other, sandwiching Jordan in the middle. Jordan gave me a high five and that was that. We moved on. In the hours that would follow we progressively became more jubilant. It set in, and while we take nothing for granted, we are grateful for cause to celebrate.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-9083135215655159504?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

Her MRI scans today revealed noticeable reduction in the size of the tumors. Her doctor was elated. So were we.

In fairness, her gait is partially out of her control. It&rsquo;s the product of the way her body shifts her weight to compensate for the trouble with her legs. But she takes some joy in the sassy walk. She works it.<br /><br />&ndash; Dad, guess what I found at Walmart?<br /><br />She is fascinated by America&rsquo;s leading discounter. Somehow she stumbled on to the Walmart.com link, and to my misfortune her parental control filter seems to think Walmart is tame&ndash;safe from any harmful content. Now, you might think that an ecommerce site like Walmart would hold little interest for a juvenile web surfer who can&rsquo;t read.<br /><br />You would be wrong.<br /><br />For the last several days she has flipped through its pages ogling at the different things she would like to buy for her friends and family. She&rsquo;s been keeping a list and using her new digital camera to take pictures of the web pages she likes (we&rsquo;re trying to teach her how to bookmark and use screenshots, but she prefers this manual method).<br /><br />&ndash; They have the most AMAZING stuff. We have to go there.<br /><br />No disrespect to the good folks at Walmart, but I would rather stand in line at the DMV while being treated for rabies with injections to the stomach than visit a Walmart store. I can&rsquo;t say this to Jordan, of course, so instead I hedge.<br /><br />&ndash; Daddy&rsquo;s not really much of a shopper.<br /><br />She thinks of this for a moment, grabs a few snacks from the cupboard and then advises me again.<br /><br />&ndash; You really should see it, Dad. I just love Walmart.<br /><br />She blows me a kiss and scrambles back to her computer. I sigh and consider cocktails with breakfast.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-8521554572884691533?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[She’s not happy. She was all set to make her very first trip alone. We booked her first class on a flight to Portland to spend the holidays with her aunts and uncles. At 4:45am this morning, all systems were go. Alaska Airlines confirmed she was clear to board. We drove all the way to LAX to learn it was a no go. The flight was still scheduled, but due to weather, unaccompanied minors were not allowed.

She was devastated. We’ve spent the morning lifting her spirits and promising to rebook her flight early in the year, when the weather is better. I told her the bright side: she gets to have Santa visit her own house.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/larryvincent/3119842746/" title="Prom Date by larryvincent, on Flickr" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3133/3119842746_855a88cb87_m.jpg" width="161" height="240" alt="Prom Date" /></a><br />Jeanette lined us up in the backyard before we set out on our daddy/daughter excursion to the Music Center for a day of culture.<br /><br />Blue light reflected from the stage and bounced onto her snowy skin. The corners of her mouth lifted slightly as the pas de deux began. Clara and the Nutcracker locked their arms and glided gracefully across the stage. Jordan sighed and leaned her head against my shoulder. She grabbed my hand and interlocked our fingers. Act two was nearing the end and the music swelled with cymbal-adorned crescendos. The Nutcracker spun Clara, lifted her high to the sky, and embraced her while snow fairies waltzed upstage. I turned to Jordan, whose face was alight with inspiration, and I asked her, &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t that lovely?&rdquo;<br /><br />Her eyes widened. &ldquo;That was awesome.&rdquo;<br /><br />When the couple returned to the stage to take their bows, Jordan sprung to her feet shouting &ldquo;Brava!&rdquo; She also shouted &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; I told her it was customary to just shout for the prima ballerina. She told me she liked to compliment them both, and so she shouted again, &ldquo;Brava-Bravo&rdquo; as if it were a compound phrase meant to leap from the tongue in tandem. It was a beautiful thing. We had an afternoon we both will remember for many years to come.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />Though I enjoy the ballet, I&rsquo;ve never been partial to <em>The Nutcracker</em>. I find it has a bit too much syrup. But I realized a couple of months ago that I had never taken Jordan to the ballet and <em>The Nutcracker</em> seemed a logical way to introduce her and have a good father/daughter day out. As luck would have it, <a href="http://www.kirov.com/" target="_blank">The Kirov Ballet</a> came to town, which gave me the added pleasure of taking Jordan to the place where her mother and I met &ndash; the very <a href="http://www.musiccenter.org/about/venue_dcp.html" target="_blank">building</a> that housed the steps where we stole our first kiss. Jordan was thrilled by all of this.<br /><br />We made a full day of it. We lunched at <a href="http://www.musiccenter.org/" target="_blank">The Music Center </a>before the show, then caught the matinee. When it was over, Jordan was ready for more, so we strolled over to <a href="http://www.moca.org/" target="_blank">MOCA</a> and took in the Bourgeois and Kippenberger exhibitions. She wasn&rsquo;t so sure about the art, but we had a fine time walking the galleries.<br /><br />As we drove home, Jordan was very quiet. At first I thought she was tired, but then I realized that she was deep in thought. I asked her what she was thinking.<br /><br />&ndash; I would really like to do ballet.<br />&ndash; Well, let&rsquo;s get your legs stronger first.<br /><br />She was quiet again. In the silence, I thought about the way she reacted to the performance. She was engulfed by its lavish spectacle, inspired by its whimsy, absorbed by the proficiency of its dancers. Like many little girls that day, she was hooked on the ballet. And like many other little girls her mind had turned to doing it herself. I imagined she dreamed of herself as Clara. She loves to dance.<br /><br />And then I questioned my own logic. I told her that her legs would have to get stronger before we could enroll her in ballet class again. I suddenly felt myself a complete dimwit. Maybe what Jordan needed was a contrarian point of view. Maybe ballet class is the very best thing for her.  Perhaps it is the challenge she needs to heal. She never shies from a challenge. The chemotherapy has damaged the nerves in her legs so much that her feet turn in sharply. The ballet dancer learns the art of turnout. Maybe a disciplined focus on turning her feet out will help her avoid surgery. Maybe. Jordan is a soul with limitless possibilities. For this I am thankful.<br /><br />I looked over at her, riding quietly in the car, staring out the window, and I told her that I loved her. She broke her stare and smiled back at me. No words or anything mushy, just a brilliant smile. A few minutes later we were playing a game&ndash;assigning names to passersby on the street. As our creativity grew ever more wild, she giggled and left her contemplation behind. When we arrived home she wasted no time changing into her favorite pajamas. She told her mom all about the day and then surprised me with a giant hug. We held each other for a little longer than usual before she skipped away. From the next room she called, &ldquo;thank you, Daddy. Love you madly.&rdquo;</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-3865272353293484964?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/?utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_content=dc_banner_250_250&amp;utm_campaign=banner" target="_blank"><img border="0" width="250" height="250" style="clear:left;float:right;margin-left:15px;" src="http://www.donorschoose.org/images/link/dc_banner_250_250.jpg" alt="Be No. 1... Give to Public Schools in Need! - Go to DonorsChoose.org" /></a><br />Last week, Jordan participated in her school&rsquo;s holiday play. I wasn&rsquo;t able to attend, but when I arrived home she was abubble with prideful energy. This is the first year since she became symptomatic that Jordan could do more than hum a tune and interject a few words here and there. She actually memorized whole passages of the songs, and when she reenacted the proceedings for me in our kitchen, she remembered stage direction, too. That might not seem like much, but for Jordan it&rsquo;s quite a step forward. It means her memory is getting better, further sign of her progress.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />Jordan&rsquo;s school is a wonderful place. It took some trial and error to find the right one, but now that we&rsquo;ve found it we feel very fortunate. She is having fun. She&rsquo;s safe. And she&rsquo;s learning. Her teachers and aids work hard to give her the extra attention she needs while providing discipline and taking pains to help her blend in with the rest of her classmates.<br /><br />That&rsquo;s a good segue to introduce a new feature on Jordan&rsquo;s Journey. You might notice that on every post there&rsquo;s now a brief section labeled &ldquo;Possibly Related Classroom Projects.&rdquo; These links are provided by <a href="http://www.donorschoose.org" target="_blank">DonorsChoose.org</a>, a nonprofit that helps teachers all across the country find desperately needed resources for planned classroom projects. You&rsquo;d be surprised at how little the needs can be and how easy it is to contribute what you can. When I browsed the projects, I was most struck by the creativity of the teachers themselves. We hope you&rsquo;ll take time to learn more about some of these projects, as we highlight those that might be similar to the step you&rsquo;re reading about in Jordan&rsquo;s Journey. This new feature is just a sliver of what we have planned for The Journey website in 2009. I&rsquo;ll share more soon. Until then, thank you for traveling along with us and for lending any support you can to classrooms across the country.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-7616550231259639079?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/larryvincent/3067190196/" title="photo sharing" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3194/3067190196_24901cbb1b_m.jpg" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Even a trivial game like a round of Guitar Hero brings out the fierce competitor in Jordan. She isn&rsquo;t satisfied until she proves she&rsquo;s the best.<br /><br />Her seductive personality, which often lapses into soulful discourse on the merits of biscuits and tea, belies a gritty underbelly on her character. Psychologically speaking, she might shiv you to win a challenge. She has a ruthless side that sparks when placed in competition. It is the essence of what propelled her up that <a href="http://www.jordanvincent.com/2007/01/09/wish-day-2-quest-for-the-hard-ones/" target="_blank">rock face in Orlando</a>, the substance of the never-ending war of words with her brother, and the very foundation of her survivorship. Jordan is a competitor.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />We fist discovered this quality about her when she was still a toddler. The kids once shared a room at our condo on Lake Avenue. The condo had previously been owned by three college bachelors and the one who occupied the kids room evidently worked out quite a bit. He installed a pullup bar in the doorway. The kids loved for me to lift them up and let them hang from that bar. One day, when Jordan was about three or four, Luc had me count while he dangled in the doorway. I made it to 15 before he signaled that I needed to help him down. I looked over at Jordan and saw nothing but fire in her eyes. She asked me to lift her up and do exactly as I did for her brother. When I reached 18 she was still hanging on. Her face was steely, her grimmace determined &hellip; and she had no intention of letting go. At 22, I put my hands around her waist and asked her to let go. As I set her down, I looked over at Luc, who replied, &ldquo;yeah, that&rsquo;s a lot.&rdquo;<br /><br />Lately, I&rsquo;ve seen this side of her burst through at the oddest of times. Our family is on a mission to eat more veggies. Actually, Jeanette and I are on a mission to eat more veggies. We&rsquo;re dragging the kids with us. It hasn&rsquo;t been going well, but then I had a spark of an idea. At the dinner table last night, I said, &ldquo;you know what? Let&rsquo;s start having a salad competition. We&rsquo;ll take turns inventing salads to see who can do it better than the others.&rdquo;<br /><br />It was a throw-away comment, something to make vegetables sound remotely interesting. Everyone liked the idea, but with Jordan it took on a perverse life. The next morning she was concocting a wish-list of ingredients. Every 15 minutes she&rsquo;d ask if it was time for her to make her salad. When Jeanette returned from the store with all the ingredients, Jordan became downright domineering. Luc wanted to sample one of the edamame she requested and a beast erupted.<br /><br />&ndash;Lucas! Don&rsquo;t eat my special ingredients! You can only have one.<br /><br />Luc went first, making a pepper and heirloom tomato salad that was quite good. Jordan gave him his propers, but not before reminding him that she planned to win this evening.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-588325430140461733?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

They gossip and sample cosmetics. Jordan angles to the side and tilts her head with a healthy embelishment of feminine sass. She is having the time of her life. Her skin shines. Her cheeks blush. Her eyes charm on cue. This is why she survives. This is the life that is on her side as she kicks cancer&rsquo;s sorry butt.<br /><br />On this day of Thanksgiving, Jeanette and I are most grateful for Jordan&rsquo;s health and prosperity. We give thanks that our girl continues to grow into a fascinatingly beautiful young woman. And while the disease still threatens from the fringes, we are grateful to have been blessed with a child who never gives up and never lets the struggle rob her of her childhood.<br /><br />We are also grateful for our friends and our family. You have all been tremendously supportive over these six long years, and we are blessed with a constant stream of love and care. As you know, this year we asked our community of friends to join us in supporting the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation during the month of November. Jordan set a goal of raising $1,000. I am pleased to report that we have raised more than $1,600 for this very worthy cause. Thank you for making a difference. Thank you for all that you do.<br /><br />&ndash;The Vincent Family</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-7578246043747340476?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

When her nose runs, she is mad with contempt.<br /><br />&ndash; Why is my nose always running?<br />&ndash; It&rsquo;s just a cold, Jordan. We all get them.<br />&ndash; I don&rsquo;t understand why my nose gets so cranky.<br /><br />And there you have it: Jordan&rsquo;s personification of the world. Her runny nose is not a symptom of a seasonal cold, it is an insubordinate appendage caught in an insurrection against her body. She scolds her feet the same way. When she tries to wear her boots without her braces the big toe sometimes pokes down and makes her uncomfortable. We adjust and try again, sometimes requiring several tries. Whenever the toe falls down again she rages.<br /><br />&ndash; Oh! Toe, why are you being so stubborn?<br /><br />She&rsquo;ll appeal to me.<br /><br />&ndash; Dad, you need to talk to Toe. She won&rsquo;t get back up.<br /><br />I always comply. I have a chat with Toe, then supervise as Jordan tries again. It&rsquo;s half play and half her view of the world. Everything has a personality, none more than she. <a name="more"></a><br /><br />Still, she sounds far more sickly when she has a cold than she has at times when cancer has had the best of her. She can weather chemotherapy, brain surgery, and a litany of seizures without much complaint. She bounces back, displaying strength unfathomable&ndash;the kind of strength that arrests you and makes you feel terribly small. But a cold &hellip; you&rsquo;d think she was stricken with consumption. She slouches around the house, whines and laments her failing health. I received three phone messages on Thursday, while I was traveling. Each was more pitiful than the last. It&rsquo;s the contradiction of Jordan, the dichotomy that makes her irresistible.<br /><br />She&rsquo;s feeling much better now. The cold has passed. She spent the weekend at her grandparents, saw a movie and snacked on her favorite munchies. She even helped her mom clean her room (dissect that phrase, something isn&rsquo;t right). She&rsquo;s doing well. I&rsquo;ve noticed that she is calmer now that the big date with the MRI has passed and the results were good. She&rsquo;ll be just fine until she happens upon the next batch of sniffles.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-2447830089087666989?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

Though the radiologist has not delivered the report yet, Jordan&rsquo;s oncologist has completed a preliminary review of the scans and reports that she is continuing to make progress. From his read, it appears her condition is stable, which is much better than we feared. Jordan&rsquo;s persistent headaches, back aches and nausea worried us. We were all expecting that the tumor might have won this battle. But it seems Jordan is still kicking its butt &hellip; or at least holding the battle line.<br /><br />She is exhausted. It was a very long day and she was so nervous in the morning that I think she&rsquo;s now completely spent. We took her to Denny&rsquo;s (at her request). She ate a pancake breakfast <strong>and</strong> a hot dog plate. She is now taking calls from her family and lounging in front of the television. Thank you, everyone, for all the kind words of support. We definitely did not feel alone these last few days.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-1613657990451865599?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She heads to CHLA in about an hour for her quarterly MRI. I&rsquo;ve never seen her this anxious before. She&rsquo;s really worked herself up into a bundle of nerves. To top it off, she&rsquo;s had a nasty headache since she awoke. When you add that to the mandatory fasting before anesthesia, you have an uncomfortable, nervous, somewhat dramatic patient on your hands. But she has reason to be nervous, so we sit with her, hold her hand, share encouraging stories, and try to keep her comfortable.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few years ago, I decided to take a slightly objective point of view to this blog site. Although it is nearly impossible not to inject my feelings, I wanted to chronicle Jordan&rsquo;s story so that she could appreciate it years later. It wasn&rsquo;t so much that I wanted to distance myself, but more that I wanted the site to be about her, rather than me.<br /><br />This post is an exception to the rule. This post comes from inside. It might make you uncomfortable. It makes me uncomfortable. But, it&rsquo;s part of the journey.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />I connect my laptop to a secondary display when I&rsquo;m docked at home. It&rsquo;s my way of nerding out whenever I can, but it doesn&rsquo;t always get a lot of use. When I&rsquo;m not moving files over to it, it just shows random pictures of the family. This evening, it cycled through several of my favorite photos of Jordan. She is so beautiful. At times I had to stop what I was doing to just admire the photos. That&rsquo;s when I thought of the memento factor, or TMF for short. TMF has haunted me since Jordan was first diagnosed. It&rsquo;s a strange, unsettling feeling that washes over you at the oddest times. It&rsquo;s charged with sentamentality, forced nostalgia and unwarranted remorse. It&rsquo;s the feeling you get when you think that what you&rsquo;re experiencing must be preserved because it will be all that is left one day.<br /><br />The first time I really succombed to TMF was in Hawaii, shortly after the photo shown in the header of this blog was taken. Jordan and I were walking on the beach in Ka'anapali, goofing around and having much fun. The sun was setting and we admired the picturesque scenery around us. Jeanette and Luc skirted around us at different times, but Jordan and I were kind of in our own world. We got to laughing about something as we tip toed around the surf. We stopped and Jordan walked a few steps into the water, enjoying its warmth. I stared down at the beach and watched her footstep erode into the sand. It was then that it hit me. Without any warning, I was out cold with emotion. I had to turn away so that Jordan wouldn&rsquo;t notice. Jeanette knew something was wrong. She tried to catch up to me as I quicked the pace of my leisurely stroll on the beach. When she got to me, my eyes were puffy and I looked like a wreck. She asked what was wrong and I told her. I told her that I worried that the next time we visited Hawaii, we&rsquo;d be a smaller family.<br /><br />The Memento Factor saps the soul. It doesn&rsquo;t just draw upon your worst fears, it saddles you with guilt. You shouldn&rsquo;t be thinking this, you tell yourself. It&rsquo;s not the way to support her, you appeal. Yet, still, when it crashes upon you, stoicism is a challenge. It&rsquo;s difficult to describe because it is not as pessimistic and jaded as it may sound. It&rsquo;s driven by fear&ndash;a fear that what you know about your loved one may be hard to recall one day, that the essence of the experience might be lost forever. It&rsquo;s no different than what I imagine people feel when a parent or spouse is aging and time seems compressed, fleeting. It conjures panic&ndash;you panic that you must do everything you can to preserve the beauty and the brilliance of the life before you, and there just isn&rsquo;t enough time, words or memory cells to do it.<br /><br />I don&rsquo;t mean for this post to cause alarm. Jordan is doing well. She is a survivor, and that is not idle lip service. I&rsquo;ve spent enough time with her to bet the whole bucket of chips on her. But we&rsquo;re all nervous these days. She&rsquo;s been sick more than usual. She&rsquo;s having headaches again. She&rsquo;s visibly anxious, herself. The whole family has a collective bad feeling about the upcoming week. We shouldn&rsquo;t. We know. We don&rsquo;t speak of it. But we feel it. I feel it. I watch Jordan busily at play around the house and I run for my camera, or jott down a few notes about the bent of her expression or the iconic way she shared a thought with me. I feel the need to capture memetos. Perhaps they will be used one day when I am a grandfather, sharing stories with Jordan&rsquo;s children while she sits beside me. I certainly hope that is the case. Perhaps these thoughts and mementos will breathe life into a character for my writing&ndash;a character Jordan and I will laugh about together. There are many possibilities, but only one that stops me cold in my tracks. I think sometimes it is better to consider it, than let it stalk me with its predatory probabilities and vampiric sentiment.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-2301289529523379288?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/larryvincent/3032743332/" title="Jordan, the Worrier by larryvincent, on Flickr" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3276/3032743332_51204ae181_m.jpg" width="240" height="161" alt="Jordan, the Worrier" /></a><br /><br />She&rsquo;s a little nervous. She has a full week ahead. On Monday, she returns for chemotherapy. Then, Tuesday she goes in for a new MRI scan. Wednesday, it&rsquo;s a full evaluation from her neurooncologist. All in all, she&rsquo;ll be spending a lot of time at Children&rsquo;s Hospital.<br /><br />I have previously written about her growing maturity and sense of wellness. January will mark the sixth year of her journey. In six years, any child will change a lot. Their entire identity emerges&ndash;their sense of the world around them and the way that it connects to their lives. Swiss Psychologist Jean Piaget, in his landmark studies of children&rsquo;s cognitive development, found that children Jordan&rsquo;s age begin mastering &ldquo;concrete operations&rdquo;&ndash;the ability to apply logic and tie it to personal experience. I think her growing ability to do just this is creating some sobering realities. She worries more than she once did. The uncertainty surrounding every MRI scan casts a shadow on her otherwise gregariously optimistic spirit. Last night, she confided to her mother that she was anxious about Tuesday&rsquo;s scan.<br /><br />&ndash; What if my cancer is growing again?<br />&ndash; Then Dr. Findlay will have a new plan of attack. He always has 2 or 3 in his back pocket, just in case.<br /><br />Jeanette&rsquo;s counsel provided some comfort, but Jordan grew a little quiet thereafter. In these moments she often vacillates between excessive intimacy and extreme isolation. She either wants to sit right next to you and lean all over you, or retreat to a quiet corner and occupy herself alone, quietly.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />Despite the heaviness of treatment, diagnosis and endless therapies, she is thriving at nearly everything in her life. Jeanette met with Jordan&rsquo;s teachers and aids at school. They gave a glowing report. She is working harder at her studies, fitting in just a bit more, and showing real progress in her cognitive development. She is diligent and outgoing about life. While life with cancer troubles her wearied mind more than in the past, it never seems to prevent her from finding something new to enjoy. Whether rising early to drag her mother to the local farmer&rsquo;s market, or browsing through a growing collection of hats, she never lets the disease tax her with pessimism, regret or remorse.<br /><br />She is thrilled by the response to our <a href="http://www.firstgiving.com/laurencevincent" target="_blank">fundraising drive for the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation</a>. She pranced around the house today quite proud to have raised $1,000 from her friends and family &ndash; and in less than a week&rsquo;s time. Thank you, thank you, to all who contributed. Your generous contributions will benefit smart and dedicated researchers who hope to eradicate brain tumors: the second most common form of pediatric cancer.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-8774995279692890164?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/larryvincent/3015520587/" title="photo sharing" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3159/3015520587_20295a6668_m.jpg" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Even in November, Jordan prefers to lounge California style&ndash;in a bikini.<br /><br />She had a rough couple of days this weekend. Saturday, as we started our weekly pancake ritual, she suddenly ran for the bathroom. By the time I caught up with her she was retching over the toilet, emptying what little she had in her stomach. True to form, Jordan was unstoppable. As I held her hair, she kept trying to talk to me, garbling her words with burps and vomit. I had to keep telling her to wait. She could tell me later. When she had finished, she finally got the words out.<br />&ndash; I hate chemo. This is disgusting.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />I cleaned her up and gave her some anti-nausea medicine.  She bounced back within an hour, and devoured her pancakes and eggs. The rest of the day was pretty pleasant. She complains that her back is bothering her, and she seems to be having more headaches. Her legs aren&rsquo;t getting as strong as we would like. She&rsquo;s wearing her braces occasionally, though we often have to remind her of their import. We are sometimes resigned that surgery will be the only way to repair her atrophied muscles, but we counsel each other to have hope and encourage Jordan to keep working and be diligent in her therapies. All these subtle symptoms and setbacks elevate our general paranoia and cause us to worry more than we should. Jordan&rsquo;s next MRI is a few weeks away. Jeanette and I worry that we might not like the results. But Jordan doesn&rsquo;t worry at all. She trudges on at her usual pace&ndash;confident, optimistic, driven.<br />Last night she was up for awhile, fighting her stomach and suffering the indignities of treatment. All she wanted was to go back to sleep. It&rsquo;s now well after nine this morning and she&rsquo;s still in bed, a rarity for my earliest riser. Outside, the wind blows and the air is crisp. The house is quiet, still and peaceful. I&rsquo;ve been writing, but I took a break awhile ago to sneak back and spy on Jordan. She was curled up in her bed, the covers half over her face, which was a little more pale than usual, but no less radiant. As I kissed her cheek, I made a little wish for her&ndash;that the days ahead would be quiet and peaceful for her, too.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-571893065437049350?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our refrigerator melted down. When I awoke Tuesday to a pool of water, I blamed the kids for not closing the freezer door. Then I hopped on a plane for a week of travel. It turns out the kids closed the door. The fridge shorted out. As a result, all the food we&rsquo;d saved / neglected / relied upon spoiled. Other than a few essential items Jeanette purchased yesterday, the cooler is now completely bare.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />In the hustle and bustle of the evening, Jordan and I started getting hungry. Luc wasn&rsquo;t thinking about food. He was preparing himself for a school dance, bathing his adolescent pits in scented deodorant that announced his arrival before he entered the room. Jeanette eats late and was noncommittal to food. So, that left Jordan and I, our tummies growling at us.<br /><br />In situations like these, I have a technique that sometimes works. I rummage. I hunt through the cupboard and cooler looking for something inventive to cook. Today, I had an idea. Jeanette restocked the fridge with a dozen eggs, but not much else. In the cupboard I found a can of white kidney beans. A few minutes later I mixed them with some bacon fat (yes, bacon fat) and a few herbs, then folded the mixture into an impromptu omelet. Jordan loves omelets, and so do I &ndash; especially for dinner.<br /><br />&ndash; What kind of cheese did you put in the omelet, Dad?<br />&ndash; We don&rsquo;t have any cheese. I tried something else.<br />&ndash; What?<br />&ndash; Kidney beans.<br /><br />She eyed me with skepticism. The long silent stare was not warming.<br /><br />&ndash; Let&rsquo;s call mom and have her pick something up.<br />&ndash; Just try this omelet. It has beans. You love beans.<br />&ndash; OK. I&rsquo;ll try it. Then we can call Mom to pick something up.<br /><br />She picked at the eggs as though they were laced with poison. I shoveled half the dish onto my own plate. After her first bite, she was resolved.<br /><br />&ndash; I&rsquo;m calling Mom.<br /><br />She started to get up, but then took another bite &hellip; and then another. She alternated between telling me what she would ask her mom to buy while continuing to eat the strange omelet.<br /><br />&ndash; It&rsquo;s not sooo bad. (another bite) What should I tell Mom to buy for us? (another bite) This is just okay, Dad.<br /><br />She ate more than half of it before prancing to the family room to call Jeanette and summon other food stuffs. The girl likes her eggs. In fact, she returned to pick around the beans and finish off the egg portion of the omelet. And while she was a nonplussed critic, I still enjoyed her dinner company. It&rsquo;s one of the pleasures I treasure in life &ndash; eggs with the girl.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-6558065479214085751?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

The cursed month appears to be behind us. She&rsquo;s not only healthy, she&rsquo;s vibrant. Halloween was a tour de force. Luc turned in for the night long before Jordan did.<br />She met with her oncologist on Wednesday and received a glowing progress report. In December, she&rsquo;ll get another MRI to track the changes in tumor growth. The outward girl makes us all feel optimistic. She is witty, loving and full of energy. We celebrated another quiet October with a feast and drinks. As we toasted Jordan, she smiled, lowered her head, and said more quietly than usual, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what I do &ndash; I kick cancer&rsquo;s butt.&rdquo;</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-2798104463042061854?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

They have no reason to suspect an attack. The predator stalks in plain sight&ndash;charming, glowing, smiling. She moseys toward them with a twinkle in her eye and a disarming swagger in her step.</p><br /><br />&ldquo;What a funny little girl,&rdquo; they think to themselves as she gesticulates with a quirky greeting.<br /><br />Little do they know they are down for the count. A conversation with Jordan is untamed, frenetic, and customarily one-sided. She begins with random observations dissected from a linear thought but delivered in fragments.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />&ldquo;He shoved the whole peanut butter cup in his mouth.&rdquo;<br /><br />This is a standard opening. No, &ldquo;hello, I&rsquo;m Jordan.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s far too pedantic. The prey has to laugh at the absurdity of the remark. Fools! This is where she&rsquo;ll jam your brain.<br /><br />&ldquo;Yeah. But one day I&rsquo;m going to get him back for that.&rdquo; Without pause &ndash; &ldquo;Larry&rsquo;s mother is going to take me to a movie today.&rdquo;<br /><br />If Jeanette or I are near to the prey, we generally intervene at this point. It&rsquo;s the humane thing to do.<br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Larry. Jordan, don&rsquo;t you mean your grandma?&rdquo;<br /><br />Dismissively, &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Now the pitch of her voice rises to a coy soprano. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;re going to see chihuahuas and the one chihuahua jumped up and ran around a hundred times!&rdquo;<br /><br />Easy, friend. You just rocked back on your heels. She&rsquo;s not done yet.<br /><br />&ldquo;And I like to drink soda at the movies and eat candy. But sometimes I eat too much candy. My mom doesn&rsquo;t like that. And it&rsquo;s not good for me because of the cancer that&rsquo;s in my head.&rdquo;<br /><br />The stranger-prey does a double take. Did she say what I thought she said? Their faces blanch. They chuckle nervously and fumble for a response. If Jeanette or I feel up to it, we explain. If Luc is around, he scolds Jordan for sharing too much. This is usually followed by Jordan telling her brother to butt out. Sometimes she just puts a hand in front of his face.<br /><br />Shrugging her shoulders and peering over her stylishly purple glasses, she carries on with the new friend assuming he or she empathizes with her every word. Though her sentences are punctuated with musical inflections and animated gestures, she confides with people as though the two of them were old souls reflecting on the craziness of kids. There is no hesitation, no filter, no masquerade. She says what she thinks and feels.<br /><br />Sometimes, I ask her to think about her audience. I tell her that it is her decision to share what she wants about her illness, but I also ask her to think about how others might feel learning about her cancer. I think this is very hard for her to do. She doesn&rsquo;t project herself out into others&rsquo; heads very well. She&rsquo;s so matter-of-fact about her fight against cancer, that she assumes everyone else will be, too. It isn&rsquo;t such a scary thing to her. Part of that is our fault. We&rsquo;ve never shielded her from anything on her journey. We didn&rsquo;t want her to live in fear. And she doesn&rsquo;t. Perhaps this is why her skills as a raconteur falter at times. She doesn&rsquo;t imagine that words like cancer might stimulate a sharp emotional response from her audience. To her, it is the same as telling someone you brushed your teeth this morning.<br /><br />Jordan is our family&rsquo;s Denis the Menace. She talks on and on when she meets new people, wearing them down with a stream of questions and scattered thoughts. Just as quickly as she engages friends, she abandons them&ndash;sometimes in a muddle of emotion. I am usually appalled by this cheeky style of hers, but I am often overwhelmed by the responses of the people she leaves in her wake. They ask me about her condition. They applaud her stamina. They gush about her maturity, her vocabulary and (occasionally) about her sartorial creativity (it isn&rsquo;t often that you see a 10 year old in mix-matched Juicy Couture).<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-1848962272394839086?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/larryvincent/3516141909/" title="Jordan and the Brushing Ritual by larryvincent, on Flickr" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3417/3516141909_0638547548_m.jpg" width="240" height="159" alt="Jordan and the Brushing Ritual" /></a><br /><br />She rubs the underside of her fingers across the top of her hand. Her hands are in constant motion. They move nervously around themselves, tapping and scratching, grasping it seems for comforting reassurance. Her eyes are drawn off and focused elsewhere in the room. She is unaware of her fidgeting fingers.<br /><br />Her nervous energy transfers to a quest for food. She plunders the pantry and browses the contents of the refrigerator. Nothing satisfies her taste, so she shuffles around the kitchen with her animated hands and heavy sighs. I ask if I can fix her breakfast, but she is uncertain. She craves tea. I brew her a cup. While we wait for it to steep, she blurts the ghost of her anxiety.<br /><br />&ndash; I don&rsquo;t want to go to chemo<br /><br />I tell her I understand. I remind her that it is not for very much longer. I rest my hand on her hands and they settle for a moment. She doesn&rsquo;t look me in the eyes. Instead, she furrows her brow and begins to whine.<br /><br />&ndash; My tummy hurts just thinking about it. I don&rsquo;t want to think about it. It hurts so bad.<br /><br />I comfort her with the best words I can, careful not to over-promise. She calms herself and sips her tea. Then she excuses herself from the table and trudges to her room to prepare for the trip to the hospital.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />The chemo ritual has never been easy for Jordan. It occasionally makes her sick. It requires a lot of time sitting, lying down, and waiting. And it requires a poke from a needle. We&rsquo;ve grown accustomed to counseling her on all of these fronts. Until recently, the needle caused the highest amount of conflict. But recently, chemo conjures new anxiety from Jordan. Irinotecan, the drug she&rsquo;s been taking for nearly six months, causes significant stomach cramping. The effects are felt just minutes after it is administered. Jordan doubles over in pain and often needs to lie down to let the pain subside. She&rsquo;s experienced this pain enough that now she anticipates it long before going to the hospital. To make matters worse, once she gets there and is accessed to the IV, she has to wait for another hour as they flush her system with fluids. Every minute the IV drips she wrings her hands and worries about what&rsquo;s coming next. She knows the next bag of fluid will start the treatment and the thoughts that race through her mind trigger sudden outbursts and restless behavior.<br /><br />&ndash; I want this off. If I had scissors I would cut this cord right now!<br /><br />Jeanette calms her. She rests for a few minutes, then allows the anxiety rush again.<br /><br />&ndash; Call the doctor, now! I want this thing off. I don&rsquo;t want to do this today.<br /><br />Sometimes she barks these orders at anyone who&rsquo;s close. Nurses are told to find the doctor or they are threatened. Sometimes she cries a little. Jeanette holds her and tries to divert her attention.<br /><br />Then, the drip begins. Jordan takes it well. She tries to think about other things, but the pain inevitably comes. She musters stoicism and within an hour it is done. She feels miserable for the rest of the day, and her discomfort finds easy targets &ndash; like her brother. Though he doesn&rsquo;t like the nagging and the pestering, he often holds back more than he usually would. He says nothing about it, but I think he knows she needs a venting target.<br /><br />By the next day, she feels better. Usually, she misses school and rests. Her digestive system fades in and out of function for the first few days out of chemo. She has accidents. When she does, she gets angry. She feels humiliated and has trouble tolerating her non-compliant body.<br /><br />Last night, as Jeanette and I turned in for bed, Jordan burst into the room.<br /><br />&ndash; I threw up!<br /><br />She is upset. The emotion is directed at the after-effect. She didn&rsquo;t make it to the bathroom in time and she soiled the bottoms of her favorite pajamas. Jeanette walked her to the bathroom. I could hear them from down the hall. The conversation is surreal. Jordan complains about wanting to wash the pajama bottoms tonight, but her sentence is interrupted by insubordinate interjections of vomit. She tries to keep talking as she empties her stomach. Jeanette has to tell her to wait and stop trying to talk. When she is done, I hear her tell her mother how &ldquo;disgusting&rdquo; she feels. She cries a little when Jeanette tells her it will take time for the pajamas to wash. But eventually, she settles for another pair and both girls return to bed.<br /><br />Jordan&rsquo;s relationship with cancer has changed. It annoys her. It&rsquo;s inconvenient. More than ever before, she treats it as a terrible nuisance that gets in the way. And, she dreads the steps it takes to make the nuisance go away. Her mind is preoccupied with the side effects. She has grown-up anxieties and she&rsquo;s fatigued by them. There&rsquo;s little one can say to quell these anxieties. The best we can do is acknowledge them. The best we can do is apologize and show signs of true empathy while we watch from the sideline and pray some of the suffering could transfer from her to us. The best we can do is love her. And that we do while wishing through tightened lips that we could do more.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-4107523699193006420?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Jordan set off for Portland, Oregon today … by herself. This is the long-awaited trip. The one she’s been pining about for months. The one that weather forestalled in December. And she couldn’t have been more excited.

She just called me from my sister Lisa’s house, a buoyant descant in her voice. She had a full day and she wanted to share all of it with me.<!--more-->

Everything went according to plan today. My loyalty to Alaska Airlines is only that much stronger. We checked in with ease. She enjoyed gabbing with the attendant who escorted her to the gate in the wheelchair. And, everyone treated her like she was royalty (and she is in my mind). When Jordan is 100% recovered, I hope she remembers the generosity and kindness of people like those at Alaska Airlines.

She is also perfectly comfortable cavorting with celebrities. Yes. Jordan has a knack. She engages the beautiful crowd. The last time we went to the airport, it was an NBA All-Star. Today, it was a well-known actress. Jordan met her in the ladies room. When they emerged, they were chatting casually. I recognized the stunning, red-haired woman immediately. She stood next to me and complimented my daughter.

“We had a lovely chat,” she said.

Then she asked how Jordan was doing. Apparently, Jordan had self-disclosed too much again. But she had also won the friendship of an award-winning thespian. We walked together to the gate. Jordan later told me that they ran into one another in the first class cabin of the flight.

– Oh, she was such a nice lady, she said.]]></content:encoded>

It&rsquo;s a slow start for me today. I rarely sleep past 7am. It&rsquo;s 8:30. I&rsquo;ve showered and dressed myself, but I&rsquo;m stumbling along half asleep. And, there she is. She looks annoyed.<br />&ndash; Dad, you&rsquo;re supposed to get up early. Don&rsquo;t you know how long I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you?<br />&ndash; Daddy&rsquo;s having a slow morning.<br />My head recalls the 2003 Pinot Noir. The giant portion of red meat. And the time spent late into evening playing on Facebook. None of that matters to the girl. This is how she operates. Par for the course. This week she was back to school a day after a nasty dose of chemo &ndash; all on her own volition.<br />&ndash; When are you going to make my omelet?<br />&ndash; What omelet?<br />&ndash; Daaaad? Did you forget?<br />She hands me an index card with a drawing she&rsquo;s made. It has a scribble of a half circle. Next to it is a little circle. She explains that the half circle is her favorite omelet. The little circle, colored in red, is the ketchup. She likes ketchup with her eggs.<br />I manage to brew some coffee as we prep the kitchen together. She finds her favorite apron and dons it as we cook. The omelets turn out well. I&rsquo;m surprised myself. I fry some sausage and pop a can of biscuits into the oven. I fix her some tea as she sets the table &ndash; replete with more jams than we could sample together. <br />The house is still. Jeanette and Luc are each burrowed into their respective beds. But Jordan and I are lively. I find myself percolating as she babbles on about dreams and future travels and snippets of dialog from movies I haven&rsquo;t seen. If a scientist could find a way to tap the energy bubbling inside her I&rsquo;m certain we&rsquo;d solve the oil crisis. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that I&rsquo;m lagging this morning, she makes me want to run a lap and write a thesis. Everything about her rivets life to observation, hope to doubt. She wears me down with chatter, but lifts me up to purpose in the banter.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-4217444277620255677?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

Frankly, I think she had too much time on her hands, but it didn&rsquo;t stop her from lamenting about Spring Break coming to an end. But she was particularly sweet on Tuesday &ndash; my birthday. She took my picture to put on a card for Sprout Online. They have a contest for birthdays. I posed patiently.<br /><br />&ndash; Dad, smile more. Look excited.<br />I widened my grin and tried to look excited. She snapped the photo.<br />&ndash; Not that excited.<br />She giggled and took another photo.<br />&ndash; This one&rsquo;s perfect. Now, close your eyes.<br />&ndash; Close my eyes?<br />&ndash; It&rsquo;s just for fun, Dad.<br />I complied.<br />&ndash; No. Dad, how do I delete the bad ones?<br />When my photo shoot was done, she made me a beautiful card, with an ornately hand-colored border and a fanciful illustration in the center. I helped her print the photo and construct the final product, then I thanked her for thinking of me. She gave me a giant hug and told me to be happy about being 14. I reminded her that I was actually turning 40. She said that was good, too. Then she skipped off.<br />She returns to school next week, after chemo on Monday.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-8553105852977360425?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is what we have so far on her POV of the story. (btw, she nags me every day to write more)<br /><br />This is a story about a girl who got cancer. Her name was Jordan. One day, she had really bad headaches. Her mommy and daddy took her to the emergency room. She was frightened. But then, she saw her doctor&ndash;Dr. Cohen. Dr. Cohen made her happy. But that day, Dr. Cohen was worried about Jordan. She didn&rsquo;t know why Jordan was having headaches and she thought Jordan should spend some time in the hospital.<br /><br />At the hospital, Jordan got a special bracelet that listed her name and her birthday. Jordan though it was silly that they put her birthday on a bracelet. After she got the bracelet, they put a strap on her arm and pushed a button. And the strap squeezed her arm like a huge bear that wouldn&rsquo;t let her go.<br /><br />&ldquo;Ow!&rdquo; She said. &ldquo;Why is that thing grabbing me so tight.&rdquo;<br /><br />The nurse said, &ldquo;shhh. We&rsquo;re taking your blood pressure.&rdquo;<br /><br />Jordan held still while they took her blood pressure. The headaches throbbed in her head and made her dizzy. Jordan had to close her eyes to forget the bear claw and the pain she was feeling.<br /><br />After they took her blood pressure &hellip; and her temperature &hellip; and her weight &hellip; and they looked in her mouth, they put her in a wheelchair and gave her a ride to a room with a bed that went up and down, side to side, and all around. Even though the headaches hurt so bad, Jordan thought the bed was fun.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-3554613655317468142?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

She calls me at work to share the news.<br />&ndash; Dad, I want to write a story about my cancer. Will you help me?<br />Later, when I am home, she tells me more. She wants to write a story about what&rsquo;s happened to her. She wants to start at the beginning, when the headaches arrived. She tells me this with impeccable clarity. There is none of the crazy logic she sometimes employs. Her eyes pierce me. She means this.<br />I have an idea&ndash;an idea for what this site could be. I think it could be a place where kids like Jordan share their stories. Writers, photographers and other supporters could help them do it. We could help them tell their stories and coach them to highlight the moments and memories that keep them going. I don&rsquo;t know how this would work, but I am inspired by Jordan&rsquo;s desire to write. I have thought about it constantly since she dropped it on me so plainly, so honestly.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-8250525665755074347?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

Jeanette follows her down the hall with several bags of belongings slung over her shoulders. The bi-weekly chemotherapy ritual is underway.<br /><br />Jordan allowed the nurses to access her port without too much fuss this time. She pleaded for a few minutes, refusing to let the team near her, but then Jeanette intervened and reminded Jordan that she had already wiped off the anesthetic cream. The longer she waited, the less numb her skin would be when the nurse poked her. Jordan acquiesced and within a few minutes she was connected to the drugs. It went smoother than the last visit, when four nurses were required to hold her down.<a name="more"></a><br /><br />The cocktail that drips into her veins these days is a plant alkaloid called Irinotecan. It is most often used in the treatment of colon cancer, but in recent studies it is also proving effective in the treatment of leptomeningeal disease. The drug is potent. Less than an hour after it is administered, Jordan doubles over in pain. It strikes without much warning. She is going about her business enjoying the games in the play room when the cramping begins. She calls for her mom and  soon she is lying in the bed waiting for the doctor to stop by and order a special drug that will ease the stomach pains.<br /><br />For some reason, when the doctor does stop by Jordan opts to go without the medicine. She rests for awhile and feels better. The stomach pains come and go. The drug wreaks havoc on her digestive system for a few days, and it gradually weakens her immune system, but she carries on with her customary energy and resolve.<br /><br />We are intrigued by the latest hypothesis from the medical team. They believe it is possible that Jordan&rsquo;s cancer is dormant or dead because it hasn&rsquo;t grown or changed during the last two years of treatment and study. They hypothesize that even though enhancements are still visible in her scans, those enhancements might actually be remnant material from the tumors. To know for sure, they would have to do a biopsy. No one, not even her doctors, wants to order a biopsy. Jordan has weathered two brain surgeries. They are delicate, dangerous operations that are accompanied by slow, uncomfortable recoveries. Besides being an unnecessary risk, the results are likely to be inconclusive. Jordan&rsquo;s cancer is a large mass that covers her brain and spine. The small biopsied area might confirm the disease is dead, but it couldn&rsquo;t account for the rest of the effected tissue.<br /><br />So, we take the less invasive route. Jordan will continue her treatment for 7 months. Then, if her scans remain stable and her condition is unchanged, we&rsquo;ll stop the therapy and see what happens. We can always resume again, if need be. But we hope that her health continues and she can live without gut-wrenching drugs.<br /><br />Sadly, surgery lies in the future, but on her legs, not her head. She&rsquo;s made some progress with nerve-stimulating drugs and a lot of physical therapy, but she&rsquo;s not achieving the right progress in the musculature of her legs. According to the most recent studies, some of the muscles aren&rsquo;t responding at all. The doctors haven&rsquo;t settled on the procedure, and if they recommend it, she has several months before it will need to be performed. The best window is the summer, when she is out of school. It will not be easy. Because both legs require it, she will probably have two surgeries followed by a heavy dose of physical therapy. But when it&rsquo;s done, her legs will be stronger and she can recommit herself to her dreams of dancing, figure skating and playing tennis.<br /><br />In the heat of all this treatment, analysis and diagnosis, Jordan carries on. She is certain to have a fresh point of view on just about everything. This morning, she helped me prepare a giant breakfast for the family. She drank coffee with me in the early hours, chatting about books over warm croissants and bits of sausage. We roasted some tomatoes to have with our eggs. She&rsquo;d never tried them before. On the first bite she waxed euphoric over the sweet richness of the red roasted vegetable. So it is with Jordan. There is always something new to explore and always a fresh way to soak up life.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-423372414511580840?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

For the most part, it went well. Jordan cooperated with the technicians for her MRI and she came to afterward with only minor fuss. She was groggy for the early part of the afternoon.<br /><br />Unfortunately, computer trouble at CHLA kept her doctor from having a look at the scans, and it is too early for the radiology report. We may have results tomorrow. We spent a lot of time with the doctor today, reviewing her case and tracing the history. It is growing likely that Jordan will have more surgery. Some of the reports are in from all the tests on her legs. The doctors doubt that physical therapy alone will restore her muscles to normal functionality.<br /><br />As for the tumor, without having the latest analysis of the scans, we&rsquo;re coming upon another fork in the road. Assuming that the scans will show that the enhancements remain stable, we may begin down a path that ends Jordan&rsquo;s chemotherapy. Her tumor is an unusual beast. It&rsquo;s very hard to tell if it is still active. What we see in the MRI scans may in fact be dead tumor. The only way to know for sure is another biopsy, and neither we nor her doctors are keen on poking around in her head just to see if the tumor is alive. We may continue her current regimen of chemotherapy for another 6-7 months, then stop and monitor her progress at frequent intervals.<br /><br />The effects of cancer interfered in Jordan&rsquo;s life in 2003. She was four years old. From the very beginning, her journey has been unpredictable. The doctors spent most of the first two years trying to figure out what was making her sick. Our options were never entirely clear. After she was diagnosed in late 2004, the path seemed deceptively more defined. But every time we thought we understood the situation, the path twisted beyond our expectations. Cognitive deterioration. Seizures. Immobility. Coma. Her tumor is so rare, there is no probability curve.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/larryvincent/3309834185/" title="Comparing Notes by larryvincent, on Flickr" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3573/3309834185_6cf4a8daf0_m.jpg" width="240" height="161" alt="Comparing Notes" style="float:right;padding-left:10px;padding-bottom:12px;" /></a>Once again, we&rsquo;re in uncharted territory. It has been two years since her last hospitalization; two years since she hit rock bottom and left us for a week, drifting in unconsciousness. Today, she is thriving on many fronts. She is growing (in the 75th percentile for height), blossoming, and learning. And while we are happy that she may soon put an end to weekly dates with a needle and a dose of toxic medication, we&rsquo;re still paralyzed by ambiguity. Any journey with cancer is an uncertain one, but Jordan&rsquo;s journey has become an epic without a third act. Obviously, we hope that act is the triumph of the hero. We hope she takes a cue from Joseph Campbell and returns from the abyss with the magic elixir. Perhaps she has. The trouble is, we don&rsquo;t know. And so our family snipes at each other and stumbles over tension when we should welcome a little closure. It&rsquo;s hard to welcome closure when the next chapter is as ambiguous as the first.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-1302252007932051503?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been a frustrating day. As much as I love Children&rsquo;s Hospital, and I do love them, they are a case study in dysfunctional operations. If not for the unbelievable talent of the doctors and nurses, I&rsquo;d consider moving Jordan&rsquo;s case somewhere else. But the doctors and nurses are fantastic and I can&rsquo;t imagine trusting her care to anyone else.<br /><br />I took the day off to be with Jordan, but the hospital implemented a new policy that only one parent can be with the patient at any given time in the radiology unit. So, Jordan is resting in recovery and I&rsquo;m stuck in the lobby. It would have been nice to know about the rule change (especially since the hospital calls the day before to go through the procedure), but as I said, operational excellence is not CHLA&rsquo;s strong suit.<br /><br />It&rsquo;s a long day and we&rsquo;re all a bit edgy. We won&rsquo;t know how the scan went until later this afternoon. Jordan has a list of requests for her team. She wants permission to pierce her ears and she wants them to stop giving intravenous chemotherapy. I suspect they&rsquo;ll clear the former and deny the latter.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-4570275425418858935?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

On Wednesday. The mood is mellower than usual. It&rsquo;s not to say we worry less. We just cope better. Jordan went in for a &ldquo;walk study&rdquo; on Friday. They punctured electrodes into her muscles and asked her to walk on a treadmill for a bit. They want to see if she can avoid surgery on her legs. The jury is out. But at least we have more data. Data is good. We&rsquo;ll have a dose more on the progress in her head on Wednesday. Think good thoughts.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-7083066619251125837?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

It&rsquo;s prime writing time. Quiet, new, open. Even though I was up until nearly 2am last night, it didn&rsquo;t stop me from rolling out of bed by 7 without any help of the alarm. Twenty minutes later and I was sipping coffee, clacking away on a new writing project. I got so absorbed in it I almost didn&rsquo;t hear Jordan foraging through the pantry. The back of her head was all that was visible between the oak doors. Her uncombed hair scattered about as she dug around looking for a box of cereal.<br /><br />&ndash; How did you sleep, pumpkin?<br />&ndash; Oh, alright, but I&rsquo;m a monkey today.<br />&ndash; And you&rsquo;re a monkey who slept well?<br />&ndash; Yes, I am. Can you help me pour the milk?<br /><br />I sat her down at the dining room table and fixed her some tea. When it was ready she asked for the monkey cup&ndash;a piece of china my sister sent her years ago. She doesn&rsquo;t always ask for it, but there is no doubt she favors it. <a name="more"></a><br /><br />&ndash; One eye open and one eye closed.<br /><br />She spouted this out of the blue. No context. I asked her to repeat it, and she did. Again, I just stared back at her. She didn&rsquo;t mind that I didn&rsquo;t understand. She just kept eating her cereal and sipping her tea.<br /><br />&ndash; What has one eye open and one eye closed?, I asked.<br />&ndash; A monkey, she said.<br /><br />Then she pointed to the tea cup. Indeed, one of the monkeys is winking. Mystery solved. And then, in a way that only Jordan can, she linked it back to herself.<br /><br />&ndash; Just like me.<br />&ndash; You like to wink?<br />&ndash; No. Remember when I saw two daddies. I closed my eye so there would be only one.<br /><br />It&rsquo;s the way her memory works and it always catches us off guard. She was referring to the time when she first showed symptoms, long before an actual cancer diagnosis and shortly before her first surgery. Diplopia, they call it. There was so much pressure in her brain that the optic nerves were affected and she began seeing double. That was when we knew her headache was more than a sinus infection. It was more than six years ago, yet she still remembers it.<br /><br />Perhaps the winking monkeys remind her.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-5415800947561773892?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I scold her for a deed that is endearing. In truth, she comes by it honestly. When I was a boy, and my mother would come home from work, I would bombard her with requests and selfish enthusiasm. She would often respond, &ldquo;Larry, I just walked through the door.&rdquo; Now, when I find myself rebuffing Jordan for her lack of timing, I think my mom must receive a signal and smugly smile. Jordan takes my misguided action to an entirely new level. Every night when I get home, she attacks me with observations, mid-sentence exclamations and requests for far-off objectives. Tonight was the piece de resistance. Tonight, I hadn&rsquo;t even stepped out of my car when I heard her beckoning call.<br /><br />&ndash; Dad, are you going to setup my computer?<br /><br />The girl doesn&rsquo;t do well without her digital. Her computer finally died a few weeks ago. I found her a loaner laptop, but she accidentally dropped it and put it out of service. I couldn&rsquo;t get mad at her, even though she yelled at me and told me to yell. &ldquo;GO AHEAD DAD AND YELL AT ME,&rdquo; she shrieked. &ldquo;I broke the computer. Go ahead. Yell!&rdquo; If it was a strategy, it was brilliant. I didn&rsquo;t yell. But I also didn&rsquo;t rush to replace it. Meanwhile, she cribbed time on each of our computers, conveniently satisfying her addiction to Disney, Nickelodeon and PBS Kids online.<br /><br />I had an old Mac cube in storage. Over the weekend I gussied it up and got it ready for the girl, but I refused to let her use it until her room was clean. This, in itself, was an ordeal. Yesterday, the feat was accomplished, and within minutes I was getting calls on my mobile (I was in Denver).<br /><br />&ndash; Dad, can you install my computer when you get home?<br /><br />I got home too late to mess with the electronics. This morning she left me another message; coquettish, determined and precisely unsubtle.<br /><br />&ndash; Dad, if you are feeling like it when you get home, can you please setup my computer? That&rsquo;s my only question. Love &hellip; your daughter &hellip; Jordan.<br /><br />That&rsquo;s how she signs off on her voicemails: as though it&rsquo;s a letter and perhaps I don&rsquo;t know who it is on my phone.<br /><br />So it was, when I stepped out of my car to see her standing in the open doorway, draped in her pajamas, smiling and rattling on as though we had been chatting for an hour. She just went at me, with a coy line of reasoning that couldn&rsquo;t be dismissed; not a care about the fact that I had been driving for an hour and finishing a long day. It was hard to be cross with her. There was just something so lovable about it. I heard my mother saying, &ldquo;someday, I hope you have children just like you.&rdquo; And I do. And in some ways, I don&rsquo;t. Jordan&rsquo;s tenacity reaches far beyond any strength I could attempt, and it always bowls me over. And I thank every spirit that guides me. As much as she drives me mad, I relish every part of what makes her tick.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-477165927526831964?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

I have to pull the phone away from my ear a bit.</p><br /><br />&ndash; Dad, there are cats on the roof.<br /><br />More bursts of laughter.<br /><br />&ndash; Isn&rsquo;t that silly?<br /><br />It makes my day, this random observation shared with me in an equally random phone call. I haven&rsquo;t seen her all week. I&rsquo;ve been on the road. I won&rsquo;t be seeing her anytime soon, either. She is in the parking lot of the Ronald Macdonald House near Children&rsquo;s Hospital, where she is preparing to board a bus headed for Apple Valley for RMHC&rsquo;s annual winter camp. Her brother is joining her.<br /><br />Sending Luc along was a chore. He didn&rsquo;t want to go. Though he loves camp, he is uncomfortable with the Ronald Macdonald camps. He is uncomfortable with anything that explicitly addresses cancer. But we insisted. The camp is a great place for siblings. Three years ago, Luc befriended a young boy his age whose sister was also battling a brain tumor. They became fast friends. Two years ago, that boy&rsquo;s sister lost her battle with the disease. Jordan openly wept when she received the news, but Luc was silent. This year, his friend is returning to camp. Both families thought it would be good for the boys to reconnect.<br /><br />I hope the experience is good for Luc and that he has fun. He keeps much to himself. While it is a sign of his maturity, it is also cause for concern. I hope he realizes that he is not alone, that life is about living, and that no matter how dark the days may or may not grow, he is never to blame. It is my wish that some day soon he can survey the whole journey and see the beauty on the fringes. I know that, just as it shapes Jordan&rsquo;s life, it shall endow Luc with an indelible point of view.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-4019567871907513494?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

She was just delighted to see him. She is very fond of Dr. Finlay. He was accompanied by doctors from Moscow who were visiting and intrigued by Jordan&rsquo;s case. She didn&rsquo;t mind. She&rsquo;s also fond of a larger audience.<br /><br />One minor update &ndash; she is now able to take her oral chemotherapy pills on her own. This is a *big* deal for her. As you might know from <a href="http://www.jordanvincent.com/2004/11/30/apple-sauce-toxin-and-blue-sprinkles/" target="_blank">earlier posts</a>, for a long time we had to break the pills apart and mix them in with apple sauce. She hated the taste. But a few days ago she decided to try swallowing the pills whole. She was successful and now she actually gets excited when it&rsquo;s medicine time. Unfortunately, her infectious enthusiasm has also resulted in a bizarre catch phrase. When I got home last night, the first words out of her mouth were, &ldquo;Dad, I just love taking my pills.&rdquo; It just sounds wrong.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-6910449603216045547?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

Before I could finish saying hello, Jordan interrupted me.<br /><br />&ndash; Daddy, I can stop chemo!<br /><br />Her voice was charged with excitement. She rattled off a thousand words a minute without a breath. I don&rsquo;t even recall most of what she said. I just lingered on the opening salvo. Jordan is stopping chemo.<br /><br />She was a nervous beast this morning, yelling at her mom, yelling at her brother, pouting, fidgeting, and storming around in a moody melange of emotion. We had every reason to believe the appointment would go well, but it didn&rsquo;t abate the anxiety we all felt, most of all Jordan. When the news finally came, she sounded like a different kid.<br /><br />Of course, we&rsquo;re relieved and cautious. We have to temper our excitement. We&rsquo;re celebrating, but we&rsquo;re mindful that next month we could get the news that the tumor is active again. Like everything on Jordan&rsquo;s Journey, there is no definitive milestone, and no concrete state of being. We have learned to live one day at a time&ndash;celebrate the good ones, weather through the bad. Today is a great day. Tomorrow we start again.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-5589586597311530218?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/65/164852245_f7154edbba_m.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/65/164852245_f7154edbba_m.jpg" class="alignleft" width="240" height="180" /></a><br />Monday is a big day. Not because it marks the first Monday Night Football game of the season. Not because it starts the first full week of school for the kids. Not even because it is Amy Winehouse&rsquo;s birthday (one of Jordan&rsquo;s favorite singers). Monday, September 14th may be the end of a road we&rsquo;ve been traveling for five years. Jordan goes in for an MRI that morning. If her scans show the same progress we&rsquo;ve seen for the last 12 months, Jordan will stop all chemotherapy. She may soon enjoy a life without pills and infusions, without long hours in an oncology clinic, without trepidation and anxiety about the side effects of her chemical cocktails. While the journey is certainly not over, this road may be dead-ending onto a sunny beach.<br /><br />She&rsquo;s nervous, of course. She knows that an MRI means anesthesia, which means needles and grogginess. But, she&rsquo;s also hopeful. She tells people she&rsquo;s kicking cancer&rsquo;s butt, but I think this milestone may actually give her confidence that she wasn&rsquo;t just boasting. I asked her about her thoughts this morning over our weekly Saturday breakfast of pancakes and tea.<br /><br />&ndash; Yeah, I don&rsquo;t want to get poked.<br /><br />&ndash; But don&rsquo;t you feel good about maybe being done with chemo?<br /><br />&ndash; Yeah.<br /><br />She was silent for a moment.<br /><br />&ndash; Hey, Daddy, I&rsquo;m just like Billie Armstrong. I really kicked it&rsquo;s butt.<br /><br />She often confuses names. She means Lance Armstrong. I understand this because I understand how her dizzy logic works. She used jazz as an anchor. She loves Billie Holiday. She connected Billie to Louis Armstrong, who has the same last name as her cancer-fighting hero, Lance Armstrong. Don&rsquo;t ask me how I connected the dots. I just speak Jordan.<br /><br />The reality, of course, is that we don&rsquo;t know if the fight is over. September 14th begins a carefully planned gamble. She will be going back in for follow-up MRI scans quite frequently for the next year. Her doctor will be looking for any sign of tumor growth. If there&rsquo;s even an inkling that something is afoot, she&rsquo;ll be back on the chemo regimen. We&rsquo;ll be keeping our fingers crossed. I suspect that from this day forward Jeanette and I will scrutinize everything. When she fumbles with a word or slurs her speech, we&rsquo;ll wonder if a seizure is imminent. When she struggles with a math problem, we&rsquo;ll wonder if the tumor is toying with her cognitive function. When she complains of a headache, we&rsquo;ll wonder if the monster&rsquo;s awakened.<br /><br />None of these worries will dampen our spirits this week if the results stream in as we hope. It&rsquo;s hardly the end of Jordan&rsquo;s Journey. Like any great mythic hero, she still has to return back to her ordinary life after slaying the dragon. She has to return home with the mythical elixir. For Jordan, this means strengthening her legs, bolstering her studies, learning to read. There&rsquo;s much more ahead, but the end of a road can be a very satisfying milestone. And we plan to celebrate.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-5102535676421530225?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

Jordan will read. It is our conviction, shared with her doctors, her teachers, her family and friends. It is the gift that eludes her, yet she never alludes to her disappointment. She pretends to read, scanning through books and improvising passages of story. She recalls everything that is read to her, sometimes with alarmingly detailed comprehension. On the advice of a friend, we started buying her iTunes versions of books that are required in school. She repeats the narratives back to us.<br />Lately, she and I play a game. She has text messaging capabilities on her phone. Every so often, she sends me a text. It always says the same thing, &ldquo;Jordan.&rdquo; It is the only word she knows. I decided to take advantage of this channel to her. I send her a different three letter word every day. I try to keep the suffixes fixed for several days. I started with &lsquo;bug,&rsquo; then sent her 'hug&rsquo;, then 'pug&rsquo;. When I get home I ask her what word I sent her. She usually makes something up, but then I have her retrieve her phone and push her to sound the words out. She is starting to get it. It&rsquo;s the small steps that count.<br />She is slowly transitioning to a new medication that will prevent the risk of seizures but without making her hyper. It&rsquo;s a slow migration. It will take almost 30 days to transition to the new medicine, but we hope that this change in pharmaceutical therapy will help her slow down and take to reading. It will require more than medicine, but we all know that Jordan has ample quantities of determination, spirit and ambition.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-2146461450742099751?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We underestimated traffic and we misinterpreted basic coordinates. By ‘we’ I mean 'me.’ Caught up in the move, we missed the opening of the latest Harry Potter movie. Jeanette and I promised the kids we’d see it in theatres. Then another weekend went by, and another. By the time I actually got around to buying tickets, the movie was only playing in a few theatres. I found one with stadium seating and assumed the “marina” in the theatre name meant Marina Del Rey, which is not far from here. But, in fact, it was in Long Beach. On this hot Sunday, I tried to maneuver the 405 and then side streets to get there in time. I failed.

– I am not happy – so much I want to say.

Jordan sulked behind me in the car.

– I just need to stop talking right now.

She stewed. Luc tried to help, but it was catastrophic.

– Jordan, it’s going to play on HBO a million times anyway. You’ll watch it, and watch it, and watch it, and watch it…

I shouted for him to stop. I so love the family drives. Jordan’s mood further soured. Then I had an idea.

– We missed the movie, but what if we get some ice cream.

And just like that, Jordan bubbled up. Sugar to the rescue.

She is doing very well. I haven’t posted in awhile because (a) she’s doing well, and (b) we’ve been busy. We are settled into our new home. Everyone loves it here. We enjoy being close to the beach. We enjoy the cooler weather. And we enjoy the closer quarters. Yes, that’s right. We enjoy being a little more cramped. We see each other more and we talk. It’s a wonderful thing.

Jordan turned 11 last week on the 20th. We celebrated with a sushi feast (she received permission from her doctors). She had a great night and she was in a beautiful mood. Last weekend we bought her a new bike. I learned about a program that had launched in New York, where you teach kids to ride by using a smaller bike and taking the pedals off. Jordan and I went over to the local school yard so she could practice running with the bike and keeping her balance. She’s getting better. I think she’ll be riding without any assistance very soon.

All is well with us. We’re counting the days until September 14th, when she goes in for an MRI and the decision to stop chemotherapy. She has already weaned off of the intravenous variety, and she’s eager to stop taking pills. She’s also eager to start at her new school. All in all, she’s finding life delightful, and I find her delightful.<img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-6054410493085645809?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our family is exhausted and ecstatic, with just a touch of dazed and confused nostalgia. We moved from Pasadena to Santa Monica last Friday. Actually, the accurate description is that we moved Friday through Monday. Over the nearly 20 years we lived in Pasadena, we accumulated an awful lot of stuff. Moving from a large place to a smaller place is not fun. But the last batch makes its way over today and then we will officially be &ldquo;out&rdquo; so we can focus on moving &ldquo;in.&rdquo;<br />We love our new place. We love the neighborhood, which reminds us of the wonderful days we spent living on Mentor in Pasadena, in walking distance to all of our favorite eateries and shops. We have that again, and the kids are enjoying it. Luc set out exploring on his bike yesterday. He discovered a fine cafe just a few blocks from our house. We had dinner there last night and we toasted his good taste.<br /><br />Jordan loves the new location. She asks me every day if we can go to the beach. I keep telling her we need to get settled first. She understands but she&rsquo;s itching to try out &ldquo;her ocean.&rdquo; She gets so excited about change. I think she really loves the newness of it all. Sometimes, it causes a little overload.<br /><br />On Saturday, Luc and I made several trips to Pasadena to haul our things across Los Angeles. When we arrived in Santa Monica in the afternoon, I knew immediately that something was not right. Jeanette&rsquo;s face was serious as she dialed her cell phone. I asked what was wrong.<br /><br />&ndash; Jordan was slurring her words and couldn&rsquo;t tell me her name.<br /><br />I looked up the staircase to see Jordan standing there. She looked a little worried, but she was able to talk to me and she sounded ok. Jeanette told me that after a few minutes Jordan was able to communicate again, but for a bit she was completely disoriented and her words were unintelligible. Jeanette could tell that Jordan was trying to talk, but all that came out were incomprehensible sounds. Jeanette asked her to say her name using the phrase, &ldquo;My name is ____.&rdquo; At first, Jordan&rsquo;s words were just a stream of sounds. Then she focused and the words that came out were, &ldquo;My name is Lucas.&rdquo;<br /><br />It&rsquo;s been a long time since Jordan displayed this kind of mental malfunction, and previous episodes usually led to time in the hospital. These are the signs to us that something is afoot. We know the drill. We immediately call the hospital to consult with the oncologist on call. As we expected, they wanted to examine her. The two girls spent the rest of the day at Children&rsquo;s Hospital while the team ran tests. Jordan was back to herself in no time, and she cooperated with everyone. Her blood work and her CT scans looked good. She was released from the Emergency Room at 10pm. Luc and I bought her some Tamales from El Cholo to lift her spirits.  It put us all on edge, but Jordan seems fine. Just to be safe, the doctors delayed chemotherapy this week. She meets with her regular doctor tomorrow.<br /><br />We don&rsquo;t know why this would happen now, when all signs seem to indicate that the tumor is shrinking and she is preparing to go off of chemotherapy for an extended period of time. It can be the result of scar tissue. It can be the result of healing. My personal theory is that it&rsquo;s akin to restarting your computer. For a minute or two her brain detects a crash and reboots. While it spins back up, the synapses misfire a few times. But once it&rsquo;s all running again to speed, she&rsquo;s her old self again.<br /><br />On Sunday, after we loaded up my truck, Jordan won the coin toss and got to ride back to Santa Monica with me while Luc stayed with his mom and loaded up her Jeep. Jordan and I had a lovely conversation. Half way home, I had an idea. I told her I had a treat for her, but it wasn&rsquo;t something she could eat. She loves surprises and she fidgeted in her seat waiting to see what I had in store. We passed our exit on the 10 West. I kept driving. We entered the tunnel that leads to PCH and a few seconds later the beach came into view, kissed by amber and pink rays of the dusky sky. It was a beautiful afternoon and as soon as Jordan saw the ocean her face lit up with a smile.<br /><br />&ndash; Your treat is the beach!<br /><br />I told her it was just for looking, we couldn&rsquo;t get out. She didn&rsquo;t mind at all. We drove up PCH for a bit, cruising into the Palisades before looping around and heading to our house. Jordan grew quiet, but it was a good quiet. She soaked up the sun and sand and surf. When we finished unloading at the house, we sat out on our balcony and watched the sun set while Jordan resumed her litany of observations and questions for me. I poured a glass of wine and answered the ones I could, deferred on the ones I couldn&rsquo;t.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-5018090415738035751?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Tantrum</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was barely through the door when the scream erupted from her cupid bow mouth. She shouted protests and raised her voice as I set my keys upon the ledge. In the stalemate with her mother, she was emphatic about her position: she would not leave the room. When this position gained no ground, she hurled another scream upon the roof beams and shook the house with an aching tantrum. Welcome home, Dad.<br /><br />I listened for awhile as Jeanette calmly told Jordan she could not handle the dog that way. I listened as Jordan&rsquo;s volcanic assertions escalated into thrashing thunders of condemnation and foulness. Jeanette&rsquo;s voice remained calm and rational. The girl&rsquo;s voice shrieked and wavered out of control.<br /><br />Finally, I stepped into the doorway. I watched her dig her heels into the hard wood. She knew I was watching, but she gave me no attention. She repeated a phrase over and over. &ldquo;I wanted to watch that show.&rdquo; Jeanette reasoned about the infraction. Jordan intoned her testimony. &ldquo;I wanted to watch that show.&rdquo; She was so far out of line, reason reasoned restraint, but she could not muster an ounce of reason or restraint. I stood still and watched her writhe. Finally, I said, &ldquo;Jordan, you need to go to your room to calm down.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ndash; No, I will not go.<br />&ndash; You need to go to your room.<br />&ndash; I want to watch my show!<br />&ndash; Either you walk to your room, or I carry you &hellip; drag you &hellip; whatever, but you will go to your room.<br />&ndash; I don&rsquo;t want you to carry me. I want to watch my show.<br /><br />Her behavior accelerated. She heaved with heavy sighs and waving arms. I stood still.<br /><br />&ndash; Jordan, go to your room.<br /><br />I knew nothing about what had transpired. I only spied my daughter in a state of animation.<br /><br />&ndash; No! I am staying here to watch my show. You can&rsquo;t drag me to my room.<br /><br />I walked over to her. Bent over and cradled my arms under her legs and back. She seemed to let me. I carried her &hellip; as she would say, &ldquo;like a bride,&rdquo; to her room. She didn&rsquo;t fight me. She scowled with jowly cheeks. I set her down gently on her bed. As I closed her door, she hurled another wretched scream. It bounced around the hallway and struck me in the behind. She screamed of murder and tortuous angst and furled it against the walls to rattle the house. I walked.<br /><br />In an hour, she was asleep. The tantrums come sometimes. They have no meaning. They defy logic. And the only way to manage them is to just be calm, to let her be. Tomorrow, she will rise and greet me with a smile. She will make my coffee and join me for an egg and we will chat about trivialities. She might tell me she is sorry. Maybe. She feels it, and sometimes she lets me know. When she does, I just nod &hellip; sometimes touch her hand &hellip; and love her because she feels and lives and lets her emotions run. It isn&rsquo;t always pleasant, but it is her. And I love her.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-8604831012796767759?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She is back from camp and in rare form. Jeanette said Jordan chatted incessantly on the drive home from the bus drop off. She really enjoys camp. She rode horses, swam, performed in the talent show and received a standing ovation for her rendition of <em>Baby Mine</em>. Apparently, she stopped herself midway through the song and said, &ldquo;wait, rewind,&rdquo; then started from the beginning.<br /><br />I haven&rsquo;t seen the photos yet, but she said she took many photos. Yesterday, as we drove around Santa Monica as a family, she entertained us with some witty one-liners. She&rsquo;s very excited about the prospect of living near the beach.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-4927898081766831199?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She had a rough chemo day. She did great getting accessed and hob-nobbing with some visiting celebrities. But the drugs socked her a little harder than usual. We think her body is starting to tolerate them less. She gets sick almost as soon as they drip. Fortunately, she doesn&rsquo;t need to tolerate the drugs for much longer. Though chemo may have won today&rsquo;s battle, you&rsquo;d have a hard time seeing it now. When I came home, she was still glad to see me, still incessantly chatty, and still spirited in just about every way.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-1346702383009549114?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

She can withstand setback after setback, steel herself and trudge forward without much complaint. The other is a lion. She will overpower you with the force of her will, and let everyone in her path know that she has conquered you. My wife and my daughter flirt with strength on very different paths&ndash;paths that have converged on an epic scale. At times, they butt heads. But just as quickly, they console one another.<br />In a few days, Jordan will be on summer break. The two girls will spend a lot of time together, some of it in a hospital, some of it on a bumpy road to recovery. It isn&rsquo;t clear yet how much work there is ahead, but one thing is certain: the women in my life will lead us through the next chapter of Jordan&rsquo;s Journey.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-2011241069773710984?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

I occupied my time playing with the camera. Occasionally, she would sit with me for a portrait or comment on one of the photos. She&rsquo;s excited for summer to start, and she&rsquo;s eager to go to camp. Though she doesn&rsquo;t let on, I think she was rather pleased with her latest test results. I hope she always carries this mighty strength with her, well into the days when she is old and grey &hellip; when others begin to act a little feeble. With her will and her energy, she could conquer the world.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-730665398266214100?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

She scored 60 out of 60 on an English and vocabulary test&ndash;a verbose, dizzyingly articulate, and an often downright sassy debater. And she is 108 days away from an end to chemotherapy&ndash;a testament to a will so powerful, cancer runs for the hills.<br /><br />Jordan finished the week putting numbers on the board like LeBron James. An MRI on Tuesday revealed stable progress in her battle against the brain tumor. She handled the procedure with easy maturity. Her doctor was impressed with her height and her perfect weight. She is doing so well healthwise. I sigh every time I see the numbers. They give me hope. The medical team has set a date&ndash;September 14th. If all continues going well, that is the date on which they will stop administering chemotherapy. And even though surgery is looking inevitable, I know my daughter can handle it and make the rest of us look silly for dithering over a sniffle. I often say I am proud of my midwest heritage. Well, that pride beams through my daughter&rsquo;s resilience. She embodies the strength and countenance of Irish America.<br /><br />She took all the news in stride, more proud of her standardized test results at school than her body&rsquo;s accomplishments. Tonight, I found her lounging in our bedroom, a tray on her lap riddled with magazines. She wore her brand new pajamas. A TLC reality show played on the television, but she paid it little attention. She highlighted photographs and passages she admired. When I walked in the room, she barely acknowledged me; then told me she was looking at pictures for her magazine. Her eyes never broke from the pages. She talked to me while looking down, absorbed in her quest.<br /><br />While I was traveling this week, Jeanette told me that Jordan wanted to wait up for me so that she could give me a hug. Now that she was awake and I was home, I asked if I could get that hug. She stopped what she was doing, stood up, and squeezed me energetically. We talked for a moment. She told me that she thought the show she was watching was interesting &ndash; a show about little people.<br /><br />&ndash; Dad, look! They are little people. They&rsquo;re little. Can you believe it? Sometimes they look tall, but they are small. Isn&rsquo;t that interesting.<br /><br />I stifled a giggle and told her I thought it was, indeed, interesting. She went back to her work, but not without telling me how much she enjoyed the thimble full of red wine I poured for her.<br /><br />&ndash; That wine is beautiful, beautiful like a cherry blossom.<br /><br />And as quickly as I caught her attention I lost it. She hopscotched into a world of words she couldn&rsquo;t understand and images she revered: bright colored fashions, three column layouts, and beautiful people. I said something to her about Harry Potter, but she was lost in the booklets.<br /><br />I cheer her for her passions, and her strength, and her sometimes apathy toward the world that surrounds the fascinating universe in her head.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-7271362980953503693?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Pink and purple refract from her body in kaleidoscopic patterns–a spring skirt, a bright top, a jaunty hat. She has erupted from her room, petals showing, ready to pollinate. Her latest seed ground: publishing. She informs me that she plans to edit a fashion magazine.

– I have to talk about fashion, Dad. Because people need their fashion.

I can’t help noticing that she has found her glasses. She wears them selectively. Her vision is decent, but the specs are a matter of style. I think of Edith Head as I lock onto her cerulean eyes through smudged lenses set in purple tortoise shell frames. Judging by her demanding schedule – she needs to get the spring magazine out “before spring is over!” – perhaps an analogy to Anna Wintour is more appropriate.<a name="more"></a>

I suggest that she focus on the fall. It will give her more time and she can get to know the designers before the rest of the world. Besides, I tell her, everyone loves fall fashion. She ponders this for a moment, then agrees with me and lugs a tote bag full of coloring pencils, sketch pads and color books to the patio.

She spends the next hour and a half doodling in the shade. She sits cross-legged at the patio table, a floral print skirt fanned out across the chair, head down, eyes focused, pencil scrambling across the page. Occasionally, she asks me my opinion on the content–do I think blue is a good color for fall, should she include clothes for dogs, can we make a trip to Target for fresh coloring pencils. I answer each diligently. Sometimes, I am clearly wrong, like when I told her that her first issue should focus on people, not dogs.

– But Gracie will want to know what to wear for fall, too.

And then the question I don’t want to answer.

– Dad, my casts will be off my legs in the fall, right?

I don’t want to address this question because I don’t know the answer. Jordan measures forward time in terms of surgery and recovery. She has accepted the fact that surgery is inevitable. She is not happy about it. But she has resigned herself to it–in fact, she pesters us to get it over. When she went to the appointment with the orthopedic surgeon on Wednesday, she packed her pajamas, expecting that Wednesday was the big day. But she’ll have to wait, because we want a second opinion before we commit Jordan to a long and difficult summer.

Originally, we believed that Jordan’s surgery would be taxing but straightforward. Maybe we misunderstood or maybe we fooled ourselves into believing that any surgery that wasn’t brain surgery couldn’t be all that bad. Then we heard what the doctors plan. They want to rebuild her feet. Years of over-compensating for nerve damage have caused Jordan’s feet to develop in a way that will only lead to greater problems walking. The muscles and the tendons in her feet have layered up in the wrong places and the bone has set to support her body using the awkward gate she uses to get around every day. It’s wonderful that Jordan abandoned the walker long ago, but the compensatory system she developed to help her get around on her own makes future progress nearly impossible. So, the doctors want to stretch tendons to the other side of her feet, surgically sculpt the muscles, and chip away at the bone to change the support structure of each foot. They want to do it with one foot, let her recover, and then do it to the other six months later.

Jordan wants them to operate on both feet at the same time. The doctors explained that this would lead to a very tedious recovery. She would be completely immobile.

– That’s okay.

She wants it over and done, even if it requires more initial suffering. Her mind has moved on to the promised benefits. She can play soccer again. She can dance. She can reinvestigate her interest in tennis. She lingers on the allure of these physical activities, especially thinking about them without the constant fear of falling and hurting herself. It leaves me feeling helpless. I dare not guarantee that she will be able to do these things after the surgery. That’s the goal, of course, but I’ve learned not to over-promise. And, I can’t provide her any sound timeline. My daughter is impatient. She wants answers. She wants assurances. She wants it now. And she needs those promises as incentive to fuel her dreams. Her fall fashions just aren’t the same if they are impeded by a cumbersome cast that limits her sartorial options.

Jeanette and I have decided that a second, and possibly a third opinion is necessary. We are reticent to put Jordan through this surgery if there is a viable alternative. The surgeon at CHLA is one of the best anywhere. His credentials speak for themselves, but I’m unwilling to plow ahead without hearing other experts either (a) validate his opinion, or (b) suggest other therapies.

In the meantime, I help Jordan plan her magazine. She doesn’t have a title, but she does have a theme.

– It’s all about fashion, Dad. Fashion for people who like to play. Maybe I’ll call it Jordan’s magazine for falling.

I ask her about this, thinking maybe she was being witty.

– I made a mistake. I meant, Jordan’s magazine for fall.

We’ll keep working on the title.

And, Jordan will need surgery. Two surgeries. They want to move tendons, sculpt muscle and chip bone&ndash;on each foot. It sounds dreadful. She wants to have the feet done at the same time, but the surgeon advised against it. He told her she would be in a cast for a month and not able to stand on her foot. She said that was okay. Jeanette made a deal with her. Try sitting for four hours. If she is fine just sitting, we can talk about doing both feet at the same time. Good God! I can hardly blame her. She wants one step in her journey to be expedient. But this one won&rsquo;t be.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-409151943442275000?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I rarely read a book more than once, but I make an exception for To Kill a Mockingbird. I&rsquo;ve lost count of how many times I&rsquo;ve read it, and each time I do, it whisks me away. There&rsquo;s a character in Mockingbird named Mrs. Dubose, an old woman who lives down the street from Jem and Scout. Every time the children walk past her porch she yells out at them, scolding them for misdeeds they didn&rsquo;t know they committed.<br /><br />These days, Jordan is playing the part of Mrs. Dubose.<br /><br />Her pain has subsided to a tolerable level. In fact, she&rsquo;s able to go most of the day without pain medication. One of her casts was bothering her, but on Thursday the doctors vented it and she said the relief was instantaneous. She has moments of pleasantness, but most of the time she&rsquo;s bored out of her mind. That boredom leads her down a very cranky path. Her cranky demeanor is testing our patience, though we counsel ourselves to cut her slack, given what she&rsquo;s gone through.<br /><br />Those who have followed Jordan&rsquo;s Journey know that she&rsquo;s a determined little wag. She doesn&rsquo;t take &lsquo;no&rsquo; for an answer often. It&rsquo;s generally a good thing, but at times like this it can be maddening. She is so stubborn and independent. If she decides she wants to go somewhere she just heads in that direction without asking for help. I came into her room the other day to find her awkwardly hoisting herself from her bed and into her wheelchair. She would have made it had I not come in, but it wouldn&rsquo;t have been graceful. And it was risky.<br /><br />I&rsquo;ve been lecturing Jordan on smart risks and dumb risks for years. She rolls her eyes and recites the difference back to me. But still, she thinks nothing of wheeling her chair around our upstairs area, navigating too close to the staircase for my comfort. We keep telling her to wait until we can come up and help. She moans and tells us she understands, but then she does it again.<br /><br />Tonight, she crawled down the stairs using her arms to descend each step.Her helpless legs outstretched in front of her with pink casts ablazing. I dealt her some cane, but all I got back was lip. She&rsquo;s defiant about her liberty. And not apologetic in the least. It&rsquo;s enough to make me want to wring her neck &hellip; but that wouldn&rsquo;t help us in our cause. One week is down. She has five or six more to go. With good humor, positive thinking, and a bountiful supply of alcohol, we should make it just fine. I keep telling myself how proud I am of her (I tell her, too, but she&rsquo;s tired of hearing it). The willpower humbles me, until Mrs. Dubose re-emerges and we&rsquo;re all taking a verbal beating from the cheeky girl in the wheelchair.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-5645796328337866936?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A Note from a Proud Grandma</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>[This piece was contributed by Kathleen Callihan Morris, Jordan&rsquo;s grandmother.]</em><br /><br />Jordan completely blew me away last night.  As I was driving home, feeling sad for what she&rsquo;s going through &ndash; as well as how painful it is for Larry and Jeanette to witness, my cell phone rang.  I know I&rsquo;m not supposed to talk on my cell phone and drive, but when I saw it was from Jordan, there was no way I wasn&rsquo;t going to answer.  I even thought perhaps Jeanette was calling me on Jordan&rsquo;s phone.  I was momentarily speechless when I heard that familiar bubbly voice with her usual &ldquo;Hi Grandma.&rdquo;<br /><br />Although I definitely heard the strains of fatigue in her voice, she chatted on and on about how she just had hot chocolate and some medicine so it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt too much, how she wants to go see the movie about the dragon with me, and if I could come see her, that would be great.  So I promised her I would come up tomorrow after she got home.<br /><br />My granddaughter is absolutely amazing.  Not once did she complain to me or tell me how horrible it was.  Had it been me in that hospital bed, I would have been sharing my pain and probably feeling very sorry for myself.  Not Jordan. She even asked about my husband, another cancer survivor. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s Keith?,&rdquo; she asked,  which made me chuckle.<br /><br />I want to be more like Jordan!! She truly is an inspiration, and it brings tears to my eyes just thinking about it again.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-6717852873201018234?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

Another day, another nickel.<br /><br />She&rsquo;s in the O.R. now. It will be a few hours before we see her again. I&rsquo;m all nerves. Unlike me, Jordan was witty, spirited and determined to get this done. I&rsquo;m certain she was nervous, too. But it didn&rsquo;t stop her from chatting with the nurses about rotations in the O.B. ward. Or from cracking a littany of jokes.<br /><br />I&rsquo;ve lost count of how often she takes my breath away. She was unbelievable this morning. The lead anesthesiologist asked me, &ldquo;is she always this happy and talkative?&rdquo; If only he knew.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/larryvincent/4357627193/" title="photo sharing" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2755/4357627193_386d9969ca_m.jpg" alt="" /></a><br /><br />I know myself well enough to know that when I find it hard to write, I&rsquo;m usually avoiding something. The words aren&rsquo;t flowing today, and that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m uncomfortable thinking about tomorrow. At 8:30 am, Jordan will check in for the surgery we&rsquo;ve diligently researched, laboriously discussed, and frequently postponed. But we can&rsquo;t avoid it any longer because it is what Jordan needs and it will make her life better.<br />When I was not much older than Jordan, I found myself in a sticky social situation at school. I was inclined to ignore it, but one day when I was exceedingly sullen and full of self-pity, my mother gave me sage advice&ndash;advice I&rsquo;ve never forgotten. She said, &ldquo;you can avoid this for as long as you want, and you can make yourself miserable, or you can address what scares you and put it behind you.&rdquo; It was one of those moments where the world compressed and I felt a moment of understanding that made me see things differently. As usual, my mother was right. The fear of what I had to do paralyzed me. The thought of getting it done created hope.<br />Today, our family wrestles with the dividing line between fear and hope. The fear emanates from not-so-distant memories, and the hope lies in the promise of the girl. Jordan&rsquo;s last surgery was somewhat routine. It was when they implanted the port catheter so that she could receive chemotherapy more easily. Yet, I will never forget the fear in her face as they wheeled her to the O.R. She is a brave, brave child. She proves her bravery so often we take it for granted. After two brain surgeries, we figured this port catheter procedure would be a piece of cake. But surgery is surgery, and the recovery process was fresh in Jordan&rsquo;s mind. She grabbed my hand and asked me if she needed to do this. Her eyes were wide and her mouth trembled, and I had to muster bravery of my own when I told her she did.<br />It&rsquo;s one thing to be brave when you&rsquo;re making decisions about your own health. It&rsquo;s quite another when you&rsquo;re making those decisions for someone else, especially when that someone is a child you adore. She trusts me completely. The gravity of that trust is never lost on me. I believe, in my heart, we have made the right decision. Jordan trusts us, and she is ready. But I dread the moment tomorrow when I know she will ask me again, &ldquo;do I really need to do this?&rdquo;<br />The procedure will take more than four hours. When she comes to, she&rsquo;ll undoubtedly experience pain. She&rsquo;ll face a daunting recovery path. And, she&rsquo;s going to endure a couple of months of boredom and restlessness from not being able to animate her energetic body the way she prefers. But she will do it, and she will provide inspiration to us in the process. It&rsquo;s a lot to ask of a child, and I can&rsquo;t find it in myself today to marginalize the road ahead by painting rosy pictures of the way she&rsquo;ll cope. I can only tell myself the choice is right and take the next step with her. As a family, we are about to face what scares us and put it behind us.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-4064584241744943659?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

Make no doubt. She&rsquo;s ready.<br />We walked to See&rsquo;s Candies together to buy her mother a Valentine&rsquo;s Day present. Three blocks required nearly a half hour, but she walked without complaint. She chatted constantly with every step. Mostly, the conversational threads were random thoughts and wanton whims, but here and there she&rsquo;d reference the surgery she&rsquo;s scheduled to have in five short days. There&rsquo;s very little complaint &ndash; almost no hesitation &ndash; just talk of what she&rsquo;ll do when her feet are repaired and how she plans to cope when she can&rsquo;t walk on her own.<br />When we got home, she staged a surprise for her mom. The surprise required Jeanette to go upstairs, stand still, and close her eyes. When she was allowed to open them, Jordan presented the box of chocolates with a grand flourish and a heart-felt card. Jeanette was clearly touched, but Jordan was already moving on to the next item on the daily agenda. That&rsquo;s the way she works. Give mom a present. Check! Chase the dog. Check! Hunt for sweets. Check. It&rsquo;s a never-ending to-do list.<br />We setup the camera this afternoon and Jordan wanted to take her turn behind the lens. I setup the lights, but she snapped several good shots of me. I beckoned her over to sit with me and we took a few together. She cuddled with me and grabbed my hand, and when we were done, she kissed me on the cheek and said, &ldquo;I forgot to give you sugar today, Daddy. I know you like to have sugar from your daughter.&rdquo; I nodded and then she sprung up and moved to the next to-do item.<br />She&rsquo;s going to do great on Friday. Of this, I&rsquo;m sure.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-3727294732468109063?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[She was ordered to clean her room. It had been awfully quiet up there, so I paid a visit. I did not find an industrious housekeeper at work. Instead, I found clothes all over the floor, books piled on her bed, and a box of sketches strewn out in a corner. It looked like an art center exploded in the middle of her room. Meanwhile, Jordan reclined in her desk chair, feet up on the desk, her left elbow bent on the back of her chair, her right hand nonchalantly clicking her computer mouse as she scrolled through fashion pages online.

– Jordan, you’re supposed to be cleaning your room.

– I am.

– No. It looks like you have your feet up on the desk as you surf the web.

– No. I’m not.

I stared her down for more than a minute. She didn’t even pay attention to me. She just kept tapping the mouse and scrolling through her pages, eyes fixed on the screen. Finally, she turned and stared me back with pursed lips.

– What?

At that point, I started laughing. I know, it was the wrong thing to do. She was blatantly lying and defiantly challenging me. I suppose the right thing to do would have been to have raised serious cane. But, there was something so willful about it that I just couldn’t help myself. And, given that she’s got some major surgery scheduled in less than a week, I just decided to let it go.

We’re trying not to make too big a fuss about this coming Friday. Compared to brain surgery, what lies in store is a piece of cake. And the more we focus her mind on the seriousness of it all, the more we’re likely to freak her out. It’s good that she’s still ready to go … optimistic, unfazed, brave. Occasionally, she’ll show signs of concern, but then she encourages herself and she’s ready for the day to come.

On the walk back from a pre-Valentine lunch, Jordan confided in me how eager she is to do things with her feet again. She wants to swim, dance ballet, fight with martial arts, play tennis, ride horses, and attempt gymnastics. I counseled her to take things “one day at a time.” She asked what I meant, not really knowing what to make of the expression. I told her she’d been doing it for six years. I held her hand and reminded her how, when things looked bleak during her cancer fight, she still made the most of every day. I’m not sure she totally understood, but she squeezed my hand three times (our ritual signal for “I love you”) and then started a conversation about the delicious joy of fresh salmon.

“One day at a time”, I thought. Jordan does it naturally. I don’t have to prepare her for it. Sometimes, she takes one day a time to the extreme that she lies to herself and to the people in the room. But, she presses on. I’ve struggled all week thinking about Jordan and her upcoming surgery. I know it’s what’s best and I know it will have incredible outcomes, but I don’t want her to feel pain and I know it will be hard being so limited for two months. Still, I have hope because Jordan lives life to the fullest every day she can. Even when she’s supposed to be cleaning her room.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/larryvincent/4314770125/" title="Resting by larryvincent, on Flickr" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2696/4314770125_95b29f9994_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="Resting" /></a><br />She has an abundance of will. She can do anything she sets her mind to. Don&rsquo;t try to tell her she can&rsquo;t. She will. It&rsquo;s the part of her character that is dangerously alluring, at times beguiling, frequently intoxicating, and always humbling. There&rsquo;s something to be said for the pureness of her determination. It has literally saved her life. And it has been on display all week.<br /><br />Last night we attended her school choir concert. She has been practicing for weeks. Last night&rsquo;s performance was more of a sneak peak for parents&ndash;a glimpse into the work the choir is doing. Jordan took the stage in Steve Madden boots that beckoned interest from her stylishly-inclined classmates. She wobbled in them, shifting her weight back and forth to keep her balance. Stylish as they are, they are a challenge for her damaged feet. No matter. Jordan is determined to convey a sense of style, even when it isn&rsquo;t comfortable.<br /><br />When it was time to start, she happily climbed the risers and wobbled three feet above the ground, occasionally reaching her hand back to the lip of the stage to keep her balance. Her feet shifted close to the edge of the risers, and her mother and I leaned forward in our seats, ready to spring forward if it appeared she would fall. In truth, I had a hard time paying attention to the music. I forced a smile every time she glanced my way. Inside I was a nervous wreck. I tried motioning to her, mouthing the words &ldquo;sit down.&rdquo; But she rejected the idea immediately, whispering loud enough for the entire audience to hear.<br /><br />&ndash;No, Dad. I have to stand.<br /><br />And stood she did for the entire half hour performance. She did not take a seat until the applause subsided and the choir was released to waiting parents. For Jordan, the show must go on and the audience gets its money&rsquo;s worth. Divas always give the audience their due.<br /><br />Her will is about to be tested again.<br /><br />We spent Monday afternoon at Children&rsquo;s Hospital, preparing for upcoming surgery. On February 19th Jordan will have both feet reconstructed. The surgeon will split tendons and chip bone in order to compensate for the excessive nerve damage caused by chemotherapy. Jordan&rsquo;s feet have deformed by the sheer strength of her will. She was determined to ditch the wheelchair four years ago after a rare reaction to Vincristine robbed her of the use of muscles she&rsquo;d long taken for granted. In so doing, she created a compensatory gate that put her upright again but unnaturally strengthened some of her muscles at the expense of others and shifted her weight so off balance that the bones in her feet calcified and reshaped to support her ironclad will. Surgery will set things right. Two highly-esteemed orthopedic surgeons have confirmed this assessment. And Jordan is ready to get it over with. When there was some debate whether it was better to do two surgeries (one leg and then another later), Jordan lobbied staunchly to make it an all-in-one special. When her surgeon agreed that her logic made sense, she clapped her hands and exclaimed, &ldquo;I got my wish!&rdquo;<br /><br />It will not be easy. She will be immobile for nearly two months. During the first 3-4 weeks she will wear casts that do not support her weight. She will have to keep her legs elevated and use a wheelchair to get around, which will be a challenge given that we live in a three-story townhome. After the first round of healing, she&rsquo;ll move into traditional plaster casts that can support her weight, but with both feet healing, getting around won&rsquo;t be easy. Then, when all the casts are off, she&rsquo;ll have months of physical therapy. It&rsquo;s not a pretty picture, but we&rsquo;re sustained by the promise of what she&rsquo;ll do when the healing is done. And she has strength enough for us all. We find hope in her outlook. There&rsquo;s no doubt she&rsquo;s nervous, but she&rsquo;s also determined to write this next chapter and get it over with. She&rsquo;s determined to wear the boots again and stand on the risers and sing out stylishly without wobbling. That&rsquo;s the payoff. That&rsquo;s Jordan.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-8902047938282787155?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With progress in the cancer fight comes progress in the digital story. The Jordan&rsquo;s Journey website will soon move to a new address. <a href="http://gelosi.com/category/jordans-journey/" target="_blank">Take a sneak peak.</a><br /><br />Why are we doing this? Two reasons:<br /><br />1. Jordan&rsquo;s story is changing and moving into the &ldquo;life after cancer,&rdquo; which makes it a good time to consolidate some of the stories with other tales told by Jordan&rsquo;s dad, Larry; and,<br /><br />2. Someday, Jordan plans to take over her site. As many of you have noted, Jordan&rsquo;s Journey has been told through the eyes of her parents. But Jordan is getting to an age where she has stories of her own to tell. So, we begin the move.<br /><br />All of your favorite posts and comments will be available at the new address. When we make the switch, you will be automatically forwarded to the new site if you use your old link. You may have to update your RSS feeds. We plan to make the full switch on February 1st.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-2817308913443400242?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[She heard the neighbors talking in front of our building, leading her to dart up the stairs and change into clothes. We had asked her to change out of her pajamas all afternoon, but she ignored us. Now, she was rustling through her closet. A few minutes later, she nearly tumbled down the stairs in an effort to get out front.<!--more-->

– Jordan, slow down.

– I can’t, Mom. I have to talk to my friends.

Her friends are two of our ‘grownup’ neighbors who own a beautiful dog named Skunk. Jordan loves Skunk. So does Gracie, our pug. I was in the middle of watching the Rose Bowl game and wasn’t very motivated to hang out on the front porch and socialize. Jeanette was deep into a new book. And, as it turns out, our neighbors were saying goodbye to some visitors. None of these factors dissuaded Jordan from bouncing onto the front porch and injecting herself into their conversation.

We could hear Jordan command the discourse through our screen door. I couldn’t help but notice that the flow of dialog turned one-sided. I looked at Jeanette. She looked at me. For an instant, I think we both considered rock, paper, scissors. Gracie was whimpering at the door and driving me crazy, so I volunteered. By the time I was on the step, Jordan had shared an awful lot of history.

–Yeah, I had cancer but now it’s gone. But they still want to do surgery on my legs. And, I didn’t even cry when they gave me a flu shot. Because sometimes they have to put a needle in my chest … for the chemo. But I can’t talk about that around Noemi (her school friend) because she might pass out. Yeah. I just hope my cancer stays away.

Our neighbors know Jordan and are actually quite fond of her, which I suppose made the New Year’s Day monologue she delivered a little less intrusive. I tried to divert Jordan’s attention but did not succeed. She kept talking at them, clueless as to whether or not they wanted to hear more.

Later, I talked to her and reminded her that she needs to manage her disclosure. It’s fine for her to tell people about her fight with the disease, but it shouldn’t be the first thing she volunteers, and she needs to consider how others might react. There are many people who don’t know how to respond to such things, I tell her. She nodded and then asked me if we were going to play dominoes now.

I put my hand on her shoulder and asked her to listen to me. I received the full attention of her bright blue eyes.

– Jordan, you’re growing up and it’s time for you to have friends of your own.

She nodded.

– The first step to being a friend is to listen. Make it easy for people to talk to you. You’re a beautiful person. People who learn about you fall in love with you. You don’t need to blast people with cancer tales to get their attention. And you have to stop sometimes to ask them questions and learn about their life.

She groaned about knowing what I was talking about, them skipped on to half a story about an episode of Full House. I knew, at that point, that most of what I had to say was getting lost. A few minutes later we were back inside and Jordan was on to her next task.

I think 2010 will be a fascinating year for Jordan. She is healing well. And while her body is growing up very, very fast, she’s got a lot of social and emotional growing to do. For six years it has been her vs. the disease. She missed a lot of school and she was often isolated from others her age. But the disease is not around anymore, and now Jordan has to reconnect with the rest of the world. It’s very hard for her. We’ve trained her to focus her energy on herself. Now, we need her to consider others and she doesn’t know how. Though she has a kind heart and works herself into a tizzy worrying about others, she doesn’t know how to share her concerns, and she’s such a whirligig of anecdotes and emotion that most people her age don’t even know how to approach her.

Some of what she experiences is part of being 11. When I observe other children her age, I worry less. It’s a crazy time in the life of a child. But I also observe that Jordan operates on the fringes. Some of the very traits that saved her life make it harder for her to blend in with a circle of friends. She has an iron will. She can be over-zealous in her ambitions. And her mind is trained to ignore obvious adversity. That last one probably sounds like a good social skill, but when your friends are sending you signals that they don’t want to hear anymore about cancer treatment and you just keep going, it makes it very hard to win their hearts.

Fortunately, Jordan has plenty of time to grow up. No one’s rushing her. I try to coach her only because I want her to enjoy the company of others. I want her to have rich, meaningful friendships. I want to her to discover how beautiful it is when you care as much about your friends as they care about you–those friendships where you can get lost in conversation for hours and hours. Jordan will be a very good friend one day. She is one of the most loyal souls I have ever met, and she likes to live every day to its fullest. Who wouldn’t want a friend like that?<img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-4843418470647601954?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

My clue: she tells everyone that her cancer is gone. Friends. Family. Complete strangers. Sometimes I think she says it just to remind herself. The list of things she wants to do next is endless. She wants to write a book. She wants to take up tennis again. She wants to travel to Texas. She wants to eat more sushi. The list goes on. She told me today that this was the best Christmas she ever had. I didn&rsquo;t have anything to say. I just gave her a big hug and kissed her on the head. It&rsquo;s fun to celebrate this with her.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[&nbsp;

It was like old times.

When I awoke this morning, I challenged myself to make a great stack of pancakes. Pancakes have been a Saturday tradition in our house, but I stopped making them months ago because the electric stove in our new place is temperamental and doesn’t cook the batter evenly. I’m quite finicky about my work product. But the kids have been pestering me to make our favorite breakfast and I decided Christmas Eve was as good a time as any to surprise them.

After making the cakes and a batch of bacon to boot, I tried to wake the kids, with predictable results. Luc opened an eye, grunted, and went back to sleep. Jordan sat up immediately and said, “sure thing, Dad.”

A few minutes later Jordan and I each sat before a warm stack of pancakes, crispy bacon, and warm cups of tea and coffee. Luc wouldn’t come down for another half hour, which gave time for Jordan and I to chat like we have done so many times over breakfast. Those chats always vacillate between endearing sentiments straight from her heart and dizzying puzzles of non sequiturs hijacked from her random stream of consciousness.

She was about four bites into her pancakes when she hit me with cancer talk.

–Dad, I bet Santa is proud of me because my cancer is shrinking.

–I’m sure he is. But, you know, there’s a chance it’s actually gone.

–What?

–Remember, I told you that the doctors think the cancer may be dead. They call it remission. They think what they see in your scans is scar tissue. Think of it like cancer’s skeletons.

–Cancer has skeletons?

–No. I’m just saying, they think you really have kicked it’s butt.

–For real?

–Well, the only way to know for sure is surgery. They’d have to poke around in your head and test some of the tissue. We don’t want to do that.

–No way, Jose.

When she thinks, she has a habit of looking just past you. She stares in your direction, but you know she isn’t looking at you. Her pupils fix on a spot and she knits her brow a bit. That’s when you know she’s thinking hard.

–Dad?

–Yes.

–I bet there are a lot of people who are happy that my cancer is shrinking.

I agreed with her and shared some of the wonderful messages she’s received from friends over the years. It excited her to realize she has so many friends. She was particularly thrilled to learn of those friends she’s never met who live far away in places she wants to visit one day: Australia, England, Denmark.

She ate the whole stack of pancakes and then made her way upstairs to prepare for a long Christmas Eve. I watched her climb the stairs carefully, one clumsy step at a time. I realized that Jordan is struggling with the strange reality we all feel in this house. The diagnosis a week ago delivered closure. None of us feel comfortable accepting it. Every time we thought we had it in the past, life dealt a ‘gotcha!’ In our minds, we’re taking the conservative path, like Jordan. She’s been told several times that the cancer appears to be gone. She continues to say, “it’s shrinking.” And I have half a mind to stop correcting her.

“Better she always be on guard,” I think.

The truth: Jordan has reason to be very thankful this year. It may be the merriest Christmas she’s ever had. And while her journey is certainly not over – she has some painful surgeries ahead – she has more reason to hope than ever before. If I live to be 100, I doubt I will ever again observe such strength in a child. She’s stronger than most adults I know. And she enjoys life gregariously.

Jordan inspires me and many others because she doesn’t see boundaries. And when she finds them, she jumps at the chance to shatter them. That’s why I love her so much and why I am so proud of what she has achieved.

Yesterday, Luc and I returned from Park City, Utah, where we celebrated our annual father/son snowboarding getaway. We had a great time, although Luc broke his wrist on his third day of snowboarding. Jordan called us as soon as she learned he was hurt.

Her voice was full of concern. She asked which wrist he broke. She told me she was worried about him. She asked if he would be okay.

The little nurse kicked in.

I shared her thoughts with Luc, who smirked and told me he was kind of glad he wasn’t home. He knew that Jordan would kick into high gear and drive him crazy if he were in Los Angeles. She would insist on doing what she thinks nurses do, which is a bossy regimen of careful pampering and stern medical procedures. He confided to me that he knew she cared, though.

I think she has rubbed off on him. He shied away from my constant offers to assist him. He insisted on doing things for himself, adapting his habits to care for himself with one arm. And he didn’t want to take the pain medicine. I finally insisted that he take what the doctor prescribed after he got sick to his stomach and nearly passed out.

My initial fear was that he had hit his head and didn’t realize it. But after calling the urgent care clinic on the mountain, I realized he was sick because he was in pain. The kid is tough. It’s not so surprising when you realize what he has been through these past six years; how he has supported his sister. And he’s seen how strong she can be. Though he probably won’t admit it, she inspires him, too.

The girls met Luc and I at the airport yesterday. Before I had even made it to baggage claim she ran towards me at full gallop. She tilted her head down. It looked like she planned to ram me. In fact, she crashed into me with her arms wide opened and hugged me so tight. I was blocking the way for other passengers, so I sidestepped with her still clinging to me. She told me she missed me and that she was so happy I was back. Now, that’s a welcome I’ll take any day.

She held my hand while we waited for the bags to come, and she chattered constantly, catching me up on current events in Santa Monica. When we had all our belongings, we made our way to the car as a family and I felt this overwhelming sensation course through me. I felt so lucky to be amongst them all.

Jeanette, Lucas, Jordan: a family that together has kicked cancer’s butt. A family that survived a six-year ordeal that often tears families apart. A family that fights and laughs and loves like so many others, and tries very hard to treat each step on this journey as though it were just a different variety of 'normal.’ I love them dearly.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The news is actually better than I imagined. Jordan&rsquo;s doctors are now very confident that what we see in the MRI scans is actually scar tissue. Based on the few patients similar to Jordan who have reached this stage and had biopsies, the tissue biopsied has been benign. Because there is no evidence of new growth, the doctors believe she really has kicked the disease&rsquo;s butt. They are so confident, they want to remove her port after she has the leg surgery.<br /><br />To say that we are happy is a gross understatement. We celebrated at El Cholo. Jordan beamed with pride. But true to form, when I congratulated her on her accomplishment, she said, &ldquo;yeah, and I did great when I got my flu shot.&rdquo; She appears to have won a 6-year war with cancer and what makes her proud? She didn&rsquo;t cry when she got a flu shot. God, I love my daughter!</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-8286458893274352016?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jordan did AMAZING today. She was so mature at handling everything, which is unbelievable considering the tension we all felt about this MRI. She let them access her port without any pushback. In fact, Jeanette said that when they came in to do the access, Jordan turned to her and said, &ldquo;do I really have to do this now?&rdquo; Jeanette said yes and Jordan was 100% cooperative.<br /><br />When it came time to begin anesthesia, Jordan laid down on the table and told the team she was ready to go to sleep. Normally, she talks until the very minute the sedation enters her bloodstream. Not today. She closed her eyes and fell asleep. They even had to nudge her to make sure the anesthesia had kicked in.<br /><br />She finally received her H1N1 vaccine, and she again did it without any fuss. She called me to tell me how she sat still even though it hurt.<br /><br />Best news of all: her scans are stable. The full radiology report isn&rsquo;t in yet, but there&rsquo;s no sign of growth. It&rsquo;s debatable whether or not the tumors got smaller, but they certainly didn&rsquo;t get bigger. That rushing sound you hear in your ears? That&rsquo;s our family breathing a sigh of relief. Thank you to everyone for your words of support and keeping us in your thoughts.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-1748086350600409114?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

Jordan: Bacon-Lover<br /><br />By the time my preparation of the Sunday breakfast fixings was complete, she lumbered down the stairs. As usual, she was ready to go from the time of waking. I barely had a moment to say good morning before she started rambling action items for the day.<br />

Jordan can be quite regimented. She has it in her head that on Sunday she must be served an omelet with bacon and goat cheese. If goat cheese is not available, she will settle for cream cheese. Saturdays are for pancakes, but Sundays are always for the Jordan Omelet. So it is written. That&rsquo;s the rule, and woe be the daddy who doesn&rsquo;t follow it.<br />

I made this omelet for Jordan over a year ago when there wasn&rsquo;t much else in our fridge. She loves goat cheese, so I improvised and it&rsquo;s been her omelet of choice ever since. What she forgets is that the first time I prepared it for her, I also included some sauteed onions and mushrooms&ndash;and she loved it. But, let&rsquo;s face it, Daddy can get lazy on Sundays. Over time, I&rsquo;ve just cut straight to the bacon and cheese and left out the relish. Today, I thought I would live up to my potential. I prepped a lovely mixture of sweet, sauteed onions in browned butter, with tender mushrooms and a dash of parsley and cilantro to balance it all out. I really felt I had fulfilled my paternal obligation this day &hellip; until Jordan sampled it.<br />

&ndash; What is this?<br />

&ndash; It&rsquo;s your omelet. I got <i>all</i> of the ingredients today.<br />

&ndash; Dad, my omelet is bacon and cheese. Bacon. Cheese.<br />

I tried to explain that she had this before and loved it. She stared me down warily, took a few bites, then told me she had to think about it. She asked me to cover it so she could give it another go in a half hour, then she climbed the stairs to take a shower .<br />

I sat down with my coffee, crunched on a strip of bacon and had to laugh.<br />

&ndash; Bacon. Cheese. <br />

I get it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

She looked around the waiting room curiously and then asked Jeanette where she was. Jeanette pointed to the vending machines where Jordan stood wearing her favorite pair of scrubs&ndash;the ones she wore for Halloween. Jordan thought it was hysterical. We are relieved that when she visits Children&rsquo;s Hospital these days, she blends into the scenery because she&rsquo;s in disguise, not because she is such a frequent visitor.<br />She had a routine checkup today. They flushed her port and had a look at her to see how she&rsquo;s coming along two months after chemotherapy. Her doctor and all the nurses were struck by how well she looks, how tall she is growing, and how grown up she appears. She gave them no trouble when they needed to access her port, and she earned a plate of sushi for her good behavior. She still can&rsquo;t get a flu shot. Even CHLA is out of supplies. It worries us a little, but we keep our fingers crossed and wash our hands a lot. <br />I wish I could have been there with her, but I have been on the road since Monday. But I&rsquo;ve been smiling all night thinking about my little girl wandering the halls of CHLA in her scrubs telling everyone she plans to become a nurse, and actually blending in with the nursing crew.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-113805878317170620?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s Tolstoy’s fault. Or maybe Dickens. Shakespeare didn’t help either. I suppose if we’re really pointing fingers, you’d have to include the Greeks and all those cavemen who told stories by firelight. I thank them all for sometimes dashing my hope. Because we all know the stories. The stories have been told so many times that in our heads we jump ahead to the ending the minute we recognize the beginning. I blame all of them for making me doubt, especially on days like today. Jordan had another seizure today.

It wasn’t a big seizure–not like the ones a few years ago; the type that knocked her out, took over her body, and at one time, endangered her breathing. Today’s seizure was small. She thought she had to sneeze, and then she disappeared standing up. Her eyes fixed at a distant point. She was unresponsive. Her speech slurred. She checked out from the world for just long enough to send those around her into a panic. Fortunately, there were many around her. Jeanette was there with several of our neighbors and their dogs in tow. They were a wonderful support team. I was in San Diego at client meetings and unable to help at all. When Jeanette told me what had happened, my heart sank.

It could mean absolutely nothing. Even though Jordan has been steadily recovering, her brain has been riddled by disease. Though the tumor hasn’t shown any signs of growth, its carcass is strewn about in her head. Even if it is still dead, the weight of the dead tumor is itself enough to make the brain misfire at times. That’s why she’s still on anti-seizure medication.

But what if…

She stopped chemotherapy in September. Our plan was to stop the drugs and “wait and see”. She’s due for an MRI in December, when the doctors will look hard to see if the cancer remains dormant. Of course, my mind has skipped to the end. What if this sudden change is the second act clue of what’s to come? What if this is the warning sign that the disease is active again? I want so much to believe it’s not, but I’ve spent too much of my life reading the works of those who came before. The story is in my head. And though I am so often a sad optimist, I have no words of cheer today. No great and tidy conclusion to my post. Just a lot of worry and a bit of resentment at the bards who’ve filled my head with doubt.

I must admit, I&rsquo;m a little reticent to say much every tenth month of the year. It&rsquo;s one of my favorite months, but for so many years it was a curse for Jordan. She beat that curse in 2007, and ever since we&rsquo;ve been so happy not to spend time in hospitals or wringing our hands hoping she was okay. She is more than okay. She is fabulous.<br />She has taken a break from chemotherapy for the past two months and you&rsquo;d almost wonder if she&rsquo;d ever been sick at all. Sure, her logic is dizzy at times, but she&rsquo;s quick as a wit in her observations and her stream of conversation. We still worry about the legs. We need to fix those, but quite honestly, we&rsquo;ve been loving this &ldquo;normal period.&rdquo; We&rsquo;re loving time as a family, without needles or protocols.<br />So, another October passes and Jordan focuses on how much candy she can bag, rather than how many days until she can go home. That&rsquo;s progress. That&rsquo;s my daughter.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-1369390366059244533?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

Maybe it has nothing to do with brain tumors or medications. Maybe it&rsquo;s just a kid at age 11. She has a momentum that can wear you down. She&rsquo;s always chattering. She&rsquo;s always fidgeting. She&rsquo;s always in the spot where you wish she wasn&rsquo;t. Sometimes, Jeanette and I sound like the crankiest parents on planet earth. The beautiful part is that Jordan is oblivious to our crankiness. Once in awhile she&rsquo;ll ask why we sound so annoyed. We grumble.<br />The truth is that Jordan is doing fantastic. She&rsquo;s healthy. She&rsquo;s spirited. And she&rsquo;s always leaping forward into something that is likely to make us complain. <br />School is good. She&rsquo;s still struggling on the learning front, and the education plan is not yet in full force at her new school. But she gets up ready to go every morning and she tries to do her homework.<br />The specter of surgery looms over us all. No one is pressing us, but Jordan falls an awful lot. She pushes the limits of her hobbled legs. Several times a day she splats down and one of us helps her back up. More often, we encourage her to get up on her own. She talks about surgery all the time, having reconciled herself that it is inevitable. She&rsquo;s more ready for it than we are. Jeanette and I practice the Scarlett O'Hara strategy. We&rsquo;ll think about it tomorrow. After the holidays. Some time later. Meanwhile, we throw up our hands every time we see Jordan&rsquo;s messy room or have to tell her to slow down and &ldquo;settle.&rdquo;</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-2484787387443151986?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to provide a quick update on what we&rsquo;ve been up to. Jordan&rsquo;s surgery is tentatively scheduled for Tuesday, August 24th. As I mentioned in the earlier post, that gives Jordan time to go to summer camp and to celebrate her 12th birthday. It also buys us plenty of time to get second opinions. That&rsquo;s just what we&rsquo;ve been scheduling. We are flying to Chicago in late July to meet with a neuro-oncologist at Children&rsquo;s Memorial Hospital. He&rsquo;s one of three in the States who has a good understanding of Jordan&rsquo;s cancer (before you ask, yes, Jordan&rsquo;s current neuro-oncologist is also one of the troika). We are also scheduling an appointment with a leading neurosurgeon at Stanford University. Jordan will be earning some frequent flier miles in the days ahead.<br /><br />Thank you all for your words of support. The family is coping well. We have our moments of high emotion, and then we settle back into the necessary next steps. Jordan is doing very well.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-8984735288019502748?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Physicists and astronomers believe that there is a spacetime boundary that surrounds a black hole. They call it the event horizon. If you were to observe a black hole, you would never be able to see anything past the event horizon. Even light cannot escape. If you watched an object fall into a black hole, it would appear to slow down to the point of stopping as it got closer to the horizon. It would never fully disappear, it would just appear to stand in a suspended state of animation. The object would meanwhile continue at its normal rate of speed, passing through the event horizon with everything seeming quite normal.<br /><br />Life on Jordan&rsquo;s Journey sometimes feels like it is on the border of an event horizon. To each of us individually, time hurtles on. But when we watch the events going on around us, life seems suspended in time. Take Jordan&rsquo;s cancer. It has been a sluggish adversary. When most people think of cancer, they think of urgency&ndash;the need to stop a bully that is hungry to invade its host. But Jordan&rsquo;s cancer has never behaved this way, and her treatment has been governed by prudence and patience. It has been a blessing, but it has also led to a strange state of being. We face risks and setbacks but they are always accents on an otherwise monotonous composition. We only measure the time by marking her progress, no matter how gradual or marginal.<br /><br />Today, we met with Jordan&rsquo;s neurosurgeon. My friends in the medical community describe the guys who operate on the heart and the head as the biggest cowboys in the operating room. They speak of the God complex and hubris. But those words could not be farther from my mind when I sit with her surgeon. When he speaks to me, I&rsquo;m more confident about her chances. I feel I can ask him anything, and that he will answer me with candor, compassion and great wisdom. He was the man who told us, six years ago, that Jordan had cancer. I remember it as though that day were suspended on the event horizon. While it was hardly good news, I remember feeling relieved. I finally knew what I was dealing with and I had a doctor standing next to me who took the time to explain it to me moments after he had performed a complicated procedure on my daughter and returned her safely to me. If anyone was justified to have a God complex, certainly it was he.<br /><br />Surgery is part of the conversation again. In an earlier post, I said that the tumor was growing around the T8 section of her spinal cord. It&rsquo;s actually T2/T3. This fact doesn&rsquo;t change her diagnosis much, but it does explain why she has had discomfort around her shoulders. The issue is the degree of growth. In three months it has grown enough to make everyone wonder if it might be a different kind of tumor. Unlike the rest of her disease, this one is making changes that can be readily observed. That&rsquo;s why her oncologist believes surgery is necessary. We don&rsquo;t know if this one is the spreading variety, he reasons, so let&rsquo;s get it out.<br /><br />Her neurosurgeon walked us through her scans. He showed us how the tumor has grown within her spinal cord. It isn&rsquo;t huge, but it is clearly noticeable on the film. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a conservative guy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I usually try to talk the oncologists out of surgery. This isn&rsquo;t an area where I&rsquo;m eager to go in.&rdquo; But he explained that the alternatives are also risky. It is risky to use radiation or chemotherapy on a tumor we don&rsquo;t understand, and radiation along the spinal cord can cause nerve damage that carries its own risks. It is possible to wait, but if the tumor continues to grow&ndash;or worse, it spreads&ndash;the surgical option may be too late.<br /><br />It is odd to say, but the two neurosurgeries Jordan had years ago were less risky than this surgery. While there&rsquo;s minimal risk that this new surgery would create a life-threatening situation, there is a high degree of risk that she might not be able to use her legs the same way afterward. In fact, she could lose the ability to use them completely. She could lose the ability to control most of her lower body. It&rsquo;s not a certainty, but it is a risk.<br /><br />We did not agree to proceed with surgery today. We are meeting with another oncologist soon to get a second opinion. We have pencilled time in the O.R. for late August. That will give her time to go to summer camp and enjoy her 12th birthday.<br /><br />We told Jordan that we would not make any decision until we had discussed it as a family. She would have a say in what we decide to do.<br /><br />&ndash;Is Lucas going to have a say?<br /><br />My head skipped ahead to Jordan being Jordan. I imagined that she didn&rsquo;t want him to have a say on this.<br /><br />&ndash;Not if you don&rsquo;t want him to.<br /><br />She didn&rsquo;t skip a beat.<br /><br />&ndash;Yes. I want him to help me decide. Can I borrow your phone?<br /><br />We talked her out of calling Luc then and there. At that moment, she became most interested in getting out of the hospital and going home. We signed a few forms and headed to the bank of elevators. The office is on the 10th floor, and while we waited we could see the entire Los Angeles skyline before us. Jeanette said something to me about that feeling&ndash;the feeling we&rsquo;ve come to know so well&ndash;the dread of having to make tough decisions and take the next step. But before we could dwell very long on these circumstances, Jordan asked what was wrong.<br /><br />&ndash;We&rsquo;re just feeling bad that you have to think about this stuff. We&rsquo;re sorry we have to have this discussion.<br /><br />Jordan smiled at me in a resigned way.<br /><br />&ndash; If this is what we have to do, we&rsquo;ll just have to do it.<br /><br />And there we were again, staring at the horizon of the black hole, all of us appearing somewhat suspended, some of us feeling like we&rsquo;re speeding in.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-3221056355813913956?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

They can raise the roof with their bickering. It doesn&rsquo;t take much. One comment. A rolled eye. Breathing. But no matter how much they fight, there is a bond. Luc goes out of his way to do things for his sister when she is need. For all his mouthy grandstanding, when he serves Jordan he is genuine and reserved. Though in normal times he is prone to condescend to her, when she is in the midst of her fight against the disease he possesses the rarest ability to treat her with utmost respect and a simple good nature.<br />She will tell you that her brother is her greatest annoyance. Anything that&rsquo;s amiss is Luc&rsquo;s fault. But when she is hurting or feeling vulnerable he is the first one she asks about. She looks up to him. She&rsquo;ll never let on that this is so, but it is clear to anyone who watches them.<br />I spend a lot of time chronicling Jordan&rsquo;s steps on this blog, but she makes so many of those steps holding her brother&rsquo;s hand. He&rsquo;s been willing to carry her on his back many times, too. When I think far ahead, into a cancer-free future, I see two strong children. She will live her life knowing what she has beaten. I imagine he will live his with a perspective that few of us can imagine&ndash;as the healthy one, the role model, and the one who sometimes gets lost in the shadows of a survivor. He is a survivor. It takes courage and character to press on the way he does&ndash;to be a source of support while growing up. He has no idea how much of a role he plays in Jordan&rsquo;s life, or in mine, and I thank every star every day that he travels with us on this path. Jordan will thank him one day, too. For now, she&rsquo;s content to scold him every chance she gets.<p><a class="lightview" rel="lightbox" title="kids_squares" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4106/5068828556_18b737a2d5.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignright" style="float:right;" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4106/5068828556_18b737a2d5_m.jpg" alt="kids_squares" /></a></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-3383856584117694020?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Unhealthy Thoughts</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I must be a fountain of optimism. At least, that’s how people have come to know me when I speak of Jordan’s journey. At the darkest moments–when her health was most in jeopardy, when she slipped off into a coma, when her body writhed in pain and jerked in seizures–I found myself comforting others. I found myself projecting hope. I found myself lying to myself in order to sustain a veneer of vitality when every part of me ached and doubted.

I started writing this blog for practical reasons. When Jordan was in the hospital, people wanted to know how she was doing. It was too much to run through the details with each new call, too exhausting to explain what was happening. And people became so emotional that I found myself consoling others when I myself needed to grieve and make sense of a situation that made no sense at all. So, I started posting updates about Jordan. And as I wrote, I let my emotions run. Sometimes, in those early days, my emotions poured out unexpectedly and my posts were full of anger and brooding. But as I witnessed my daughter rail against the disease, how could I not write about her miraculous spirit? Readers were as charmed by her gregarious personality and take-no-prisoners attitude as I was. As seven years passed, the tenor of the updates shifted. I saved the dark thoughts for my personal journal, and blogged only about the encouraging, the testimonial, and the brave.

There are dark thoughts in my mind these days. Next week, we meet with the neurosurgeon to discuss what to do about the new tumor growing in Jordan’s spine. In preparation, I have researched everything I can find, and I have grown even more somber. To remove this tumor, the surgeon must enter her spinal cord near the 8th thoracic vertebra. If complications are met, the risks are paraplegia, further neurological deficits, or both. I have great faith in her surgeon. He is one of the best in his field. But I have no words to express how I feel when I imagine something going wrong.

When I walk around my neighborhood I pass by children who run, skip and cartwheel. I watch them attempt tricks on their scooters or ride around on their bikes. I’m embarrassed to say that sometimes I resent them. I see little girls dancing and I wish my little girl could join them. When I dream, Jordan is always dancing. Sometimes, I listen to children Jordan’s age engage in social banter and I know they never worry about slipping into a seizure, and it pushes me into delusion. I force myself to believe Jordan will one day have a life that is just as effortless and normal. But then I think about what she might have to go through again–surgery, chemotherapy, physical therapy– and I want to scream. I want to blame someone or something. I want to let the emotion run wild and I want to grasp at progress by summoning emotional outbursts. Seven years of trying to be strong frays the nerves and dulls the senses. I feel ill-prepared to go through this again. I can only imagine how Jordan feels.

It’s so important that I be strong for her and for my family. Whenever I think it would be best to just uncork the emotion and allow myself to be human, I remember that I am needed by my daughter. And crying, though certainly human and often cathartically emotional, is best saved for the shower.

I live in fear that reality is a mirage. I often wonder if I want so much for my daughter to be healthy that I see what isn’t there. I’m like the man climbing down into a pit of vipers, ignoring the obvious danger and admiring the craftsmanship of the rope ladder. I find ways to spruce up any unpleasant change in Jordan’s progress. Here’s a dose of reality. Do a search for primary diffuse leptomeningeal gliomatosis (Jordan’s cancer). Most of the case literature refers to it as “a rare, fatal neoplastic syndrome characterized by widespread infiltration of the meninges by tumor.” Now the ladder-admirer in me will spout out many facts that should ease your concern. In most cases death occurs within 24 months of onset, but Jordan has been going strong for seven years. The ladder-admirer would tell you that she is diagnosed with ‘low grade’ gliomatosis, which means that her cancer is not aggressive–a blessing, for sure, but hardly much comfort. That ladder-admirer would tell you that viper’s skin makes great shoes. I’m not sounding an alarm and I’m certainly not losing hope, but every once in awhile I spy the poisonous snakes writhing at the bottom of the well, and I sink into a listless mood. It’s unattractive and it’s self-indulgent, but it is real and the feelings must go somewhere or sometimes I think I will crack up and be useless to those who need me most.

There’s a line in Macbeth, “Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break.” We are grieving the loss of Jordan’s health, once again. I believe in my daughter, and I know that she can summon miracles. She’s done it before. No matter what we learn next week, our family will rally around the girl. But today I’m allowing grief to whisper to my heart, and the words I can find are full of sorrow, fear and anxiety.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr8JMX--w0c;rel=0&w=425&h=350]<br /><em>The interview with Jordan when we realized she didn&rsquo;t fully understand the situation.</em><br /><br />Jordan believes in Santa Claus. She has classmates who believe otherwise, but it hasn&rsquo;t dampened her conviction. And I have purposefully not intervened. It&rsquo;s one of the few exceptions I make to my rule about honesty and candor. When Jordan was originally diagnosed with cancer, we told her immediately. She was five. Some people thought we were crazy. We thought it would have been crazy to keep that information from her. We have always been honest with Jordan&ndash;optimistic, hopeful, and encouraging, but always honest.<br /><br />That&rsquo;s why we were surprised this afternoon while shooting a video update for Jordan&rsquo;s blog. I asked her how she was doing and she rattled off a health update about her legs. Then she volunteered, &ldquo;and guess what, I don&rsquo;t have cancer anymore.&rdquo;<br /><br />If you watch the video, you might notice a pause. That&rsquo;s because I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to say next. Jeanette and I sat Jordan down after her MRI and we told her there was a tumor on her spine. How could she believe that she didn&rsquo;t have cancer anymore? I prompted her on camera, thinking maybe she just said that because she had been saying it for so many months. I asked her about her recent doctor&rsquo;s appointment. She then told me that they found something on her back, but it wasn&rsquo;t cancer.<br /><br />I looked at Jeanette and turned the camera off. It was time to have a heartbreaking chat with my daughter. As I explained that the growth on her back was a tumor, her smile faded and her eyes cast down. I made sure that she understood what a tumor was.<br /><br />&ndash; So, that&rsquo;s cancer?<br />&ndash; Yes.<br />&ndash; There&rsquo;s cancer in my body again?<br />&ndash; Yes.<br />&ndash; Now, I have cancer in my back?<br />&ndash; Yes.<br /><br />I wanted to cry. Maybe I should have cried. I was dumbfounded. All this time, Jordan hadn&rsquo;t realized the monster was back. And, in a way, it all made sense. I understood why she had been handling it so well. She hadn&rsquo;t put the pieces together. I had just changed her perspective in a way I couldn&rsquo;t take back. I felt as though I had told her there was no Santa Claus, and suddenly felt silly for not having that conversation. Of course, her outlook is good, and there is every reason to be optimistic, but my heart sank as I watched my daughter take a psychological sucker punch to the gut.<br /><br />She took a moment to process the information. She looked frightened and disappointed, but she didn&rsquo;t cry either.<br /><br />&ndash; So, I have to have chemo again?<br /><br />I explained the options to her. We discussed how surgery might solve the problem. Then we talked about radiation. I told her chemo might be an option, too. We&rsquo;d know after we met with the doctors. She listened well, and asked a few questions. After a few minutes she told us, &ldquo;I kicked cancer&rsquo;s butt once. I&rsquo;ll just have to do it again.&rdquo;<br /><br />Amen.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-4731193727113983889?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/larryvincent/4712506940/" title="LUC_1696 by larryvincent, on Flickr" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4057/4712506940_3161833194_m.jpg" width="240" height="159" alt="LUC_1696" /></a><br />Luc graduated from middle school today. We are so proud of him. He is growing into an active, confident, intelligent young man. I often forget how much he has gone through on Jordan&rsquo;s Journey. He has his own brand of strength, and too often it gets lost in the shadows of his sister&rsquo;s larger-than-life personality. He is as much an inspiration as she is.<br /><br />I am proud of her today, too. First, she managed to keep a secret. We bought Luc a 50mm lens for his camera as a gift for graduating. Ordinarily, we don&rsquo;t reveal our gift selection to Jordan because she has loose lips. When she asked me this time what we were gifting, I took a chance, but I also warned her that I was trusting her not to reveal the surprise. She did it!<br /><br />You would think that we might have one day to celebrate without worrying about life with a brain tumor, but sadly, Jordan had a seizure during Luc&rsquo;s commencement. Her seizures are coming on at a rate of nearly one per day now. Like most of them, this was mild. I turned during the ceremony to see Jordan coughing, as though she might vomit. Jeanette turned to me and whispered, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s having a seizure.&rdquo; For the next several minutes, while the principal read off the names of each graduate, I heard Jeanette quietly ask Jordan her name. Jordan stared forward, blankly, mumbling inaudible sounds, gradually forming them into words. As she returned to us, she frowned and looked uncomfortable. I asked if she wanted to go home.<br /><br />&ndash; As soon as Lucas graduates, I&rsquo;m out of here.<br /><br />I nodded. She sat still. When people cheered and screamed for their graduates, Jordan winced and told us the sound hurt her head, but she would not leave until she saw her brother walk across the stage, shake hands with the administrators, and collect his certificate of promotion. Immediately after, she exited the building and I walked her home.<br /><br />It is very hard for me to watch&ndash;this constant, dull progression of symptoms. She told me, &ldquo;I guess my body is just having a hard time. It&rsquo;s not doing as well with the cancer.&rdquo; I told her to cut herself a break and take things one day at a time. She agreed with me, but she was somewhat dispirited. I changed the subject and told her I couldn&rsquo;t believe how big my kids were getting. She chuckled, and asked if I could handle the fact that she would soon be 12. I told her it was hard on my blood pressure, especially because she is clearly growing up to become such a beautiful young lady. She liked that comment, and told me everything would be okay. Every time she tells me that, I absolutely believe her. If anyone can will their way to health and prosperity, certainly it is she.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-451871294964747788?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

It foments an insurrection. No matter how the forces &lsquo;gainst it push, it bends and strengthens in the heat of misfortune and capitalizes on spirited emotion. That tiny instinct, a cancer of its own design, invades everything she does. You can thrash her down with bad news, but it will rise up and push her to find a light. It never dims. It flickers at times, but it never fades.<br /><br />The recent news hit Jordan hard, but it hasn&rsquo;t quieted her resolve. She missed school today. She stayed in bed, sleeping off a bad headache. She hated the morning and got off to a slow start. But by the time I returned home, she was perky. She cheered the Lakers and looked forward to a chapter from a book. The hug she gave me made me stop my pathetic moping. She made me feel almost as strong as she when she grabbed my hand and said, &ldquo;you are so warm. I missed you, Dad.&rdquo;<br /><br />It doesn&rsquo;t matter what is done by the other insurgent force that occupies her head. Her will is stronger. And for the moment, she has decided she&rsquo;d rather be herself. I love that. I wish I could summon it as easily.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-1323258942851835184?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was not a good day.<br /><br />Before you jump to conclusions, Jordan is home with us and she is just the same as she was yesterday. She sat with me tonight and watched a program about black holes, and she told me quite casually, &ldquo;this is interesting.&rdquo;<br /><br />But the day was not good.<br /><br />Jordan had a routine MRI this morning. She did great. She was accessed without a fuss, and she woke up easily and effortlessly. But when the scans came in, cancer photo bombed. She has a small nodule on the T8 vertebra of her spine. It has been spotted before, but today it was significantly larger. Still small, there is no doubt that it is a growing tumor.<br /><br />We don&rsquo;t have a solution, yet. The doctors will meet over the next week to discuss the options. One is surgery. Unlike the rest of her disease, this tumor is focalized and solid. Another option is radiation. New rounds of chemo might be another way to go. And, there&rsquo;s the possibility of doing nothing. We don&rsquo;t know enough and we will probably seek out another opinion. I am not eager to put Jordan through surgery again, especially on her spine. But, as we should be accustomed by now, we don&rsquo;t know what we don&rsquo;t know.<br /><br />Jordan is a little deflated. So are we.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-3152004175743066171?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

She moves books from one corner to the next. Folds blankets and fluffs pillows. This activity continues for an endless hour. I hear the scraping of furniture on the upstairs patio as she sweeps the deck, one of her weekly chores. Next, I hear the thump and saunter of her descending the stairs. She sits across from me and sits quietly until I look up from the laptop to fix her in my vision.<br />&ndash; Dad, when do I get my allowance?<br />&ndash; Did you do all your chores?<br />&ndash; Yes. And I didn&rsquo;t complain one bit.<br /><br />She walks me through her work, allowing me to inspect her attention to detail. It&rsquo;s mostly good. I pay her and she bubbles back to her room.<br /><br />&ndash; Remember, you don&rsquo;t have to spend it. Tuck it away.<br />&ndash; Yes, Dad.<br /><br />And she does. She squirrels more money away than any of us. Jeanette tells me that when they shop, Jordan carefully evaluates her spending power, and always saves a little bit for later.<br /><br />It&rsquo;s been a long and bumpy week. She hasn&rsquo;t had any more seizures. She saw the new neurologist, who was impressed with her composure. The outlook is still unknown, but not much to worry about until we get past the MRI in two weeks. Jordan doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the least bit concerned. She&rsquo;s only interested in the summer plans and her weekly chores.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The seizures are back. They are very mild, but we&rsquo;re not fond of seizures. She can feel them coming. Today, during physical therapy, she told the therapist she felt funny, and then she asked for her mom. By the time Jeanette was talking to her, Jordan had slipped away from us for a minute, eyes glassy, speech malfunctioning. Just as quickly, she was back.<br /><br />They&rsquo;ve been more frequent in the past week. In fact, she&rsquo;s had three in seven days. She also had a nosebleed and she has been nauseous. Each of these factors, on its own, might mean nothing. But just in case, the CHLA team asked her to come into the ER this afternoon to have a CT scan. It looked good. She&rsquo;s scheduled for an MRI in two weeks, and the doctors don&rsquo;t think we need to rush that appointment. Jordan&rsquo;s seizure meds are very low dose, so they increased the dosage as a temporary measure.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Jordan is upbeat. She has the most amazing attitude. This doesn&rsquo;t get her down, and she says she isn&rsquo;t worried. Of course, I know my daughter and I don&rsquo;t think she would tell me if she was worried. It was a long day, and Jeanette tells me that Jordan was bored and whiny most of the time. Still, she cooperated with the whole team at CHLA, and she demonstrated once again why she is so tough.<br /><br />My head races to all of the possibilities. Is it back? Is cancer picking a fight again? Is it just hormones? Is it coincidence? The place I won&rsquo;t let my head go is: why is this happening again? Why can&rsquo;t we just get a break? But the whys never work. The answers are unsatisfying and the questions overlook the strength and resilience of the girl. So, I ask productive questions of the medical team. I hug my daughter and commiserate with my wife. To make the whole family feel better, I sliced up some ripe peaches, whipped up some fresh cream, and called it a day. We move on to the next.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-1370691569469254522?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This morning, at 10:45 am, <a href="http://bit.ly/bFR8Ab" target="_blank">Luke Jensen</a> passed away after a three-year battle with leukemia. He was nine years old.

We didn’t really know Luke or his family very well. His parents uploaded photos to a Flickr photo group where I have often posted pictures of Jordan. Years ago, I wrote about <a href="http://www.jordanvincent.com/2004/11/16/the-secret-society/" target="_blank">The Secret Society</a>–the community that you discover all around you when you learn that your child has cancer. When you’re a member of the society, you sometimes feel a compelling, unexpected need to connect with total strangers. In the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chimmichunga/2973900288/in/pool-95489120@N00" target="_blank">first picture</a> I saw of Luke, I was struck by his powerful blue eyes and puckish grin. I read about his first triumphant battle with cancer, and felt a connection with his family. I wrote to his parents and we shared anecdotes about our amazing cancer fighters. I shared his story with Jordan, who asked to see his picture and commented about how handsome he was. When she learned that he lived in Portland, Oregon, she suggested that we might meet him on a future trip to visit my family.

When Luke relapsed last year, I followed his story with every post from his mom and dad. They wrote from the heart, with great optimism and faith, even on the days when cancer threw dirty punches. Through it all, they told a story of a remarkable boy who persevered and fought bravely.

We are very sad to learn of his loss. Our hearts and our prayers go to his family. I have not told Jordan, yet. And I dread the conversation. When I delivered news a few years ago that her friend Jenna had lost the battle, I have seldom seen her more somber and troubled. She wants everyone who goes to war with cancer to kick its butt, and she considers everyone who fights it a friend–even if they’re a total stranger. Jordan has never met a cancer fighter she considered a stranger. They’re all friends of the heart. Tonight we mourn the loss of a friend we hardly knew–a friend whose spirit will live in our hearts.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I hadn’t thought it through completely. The thought came into my head and I allowed it to breeze out of my lips as easily as a burst of carbon dioxide.

– Jordan, maybe one day next week you can come to work with me.

She’s still on spring break and she’s a little bored. There was more to it than that. For the last few years I’ve been promising to bring her to work with me on “bring your daughter to work day.” Inevitably, I’m travelling on the official day. I wanted to make it up to her.

–Which day, Dad?

Jeanette looked up from her salad. Her eyes said, “are you crazy?” and “now you’ve started it!” Once Jordan asked the question I became keenly aware of how little I’d thought this out. I was still mulling over an idea and Jordan was closing a sale.

– Let me think about it and get back to you.

– How about Tuesday?

I had no reason to object. My calendar was clear. So, we decided on Tuesday. Every day after that decision I was greeted with the question:

– Dad, how many more days until Tuesday?

On Monday, she called me at my office mid-day to ask if she should pack a lunch. I told her that I would be happy to take her to lunch when she came to visit.

– Where would you like to take me?

Closing again. Fortunately, she was delighted to learn there is a Baja Fresh near the office. She can be an easy date.

Anyone who’s followed Jordan’s Journey knows two things about Jordan. First, she can be stubborn as a mule. Second, when she gets agitated about something, everyone around her knows she’s agitated. Neither of those qualities are great fits for a professional office. That’s why Jeanette and I devised a suitable EVAC plan. If Jordan started acting up, Jeanette was ready to start up the Jeep and escort Jordan home. I’m happy to say that said plan was completely unnecessary.

Jordan rose early, had breakfast with me, and was ready to head for the bus before me. She was thrilled to learn that the bus has a special ramp for wheelchairs. She thought it was cool and she talked up the bus driver as he secured her chair. He turned to me and said, “man, she has an amazing attitude!”

She spent the first hour in my office coloring quietly. When it was time for my first meeting, I introduced her to our conference room, and our Wii setup. She split her time over the next couple of hours playing Wii sports, coloring in her books, and doodling on our white boards. When I checked on her, she was giddy. No interest in going home. I gave her a tour of the office, which she insisted doing on foot, not in the chair. After my next meeting, I found her chatting with a couple of strategists. She was smiling and talking about her aspirations for fashion design. She was also wearing her sunglasses indoors. We had lunch and Jordan bought cookies for the office. I figured it was just a matter of time before she told me she was bored and I’d need to call in Jeanette. Nope.

During my next conference call I saw Jordan walk past my office with my boss. They were carrying on as if they’d discovered a new restaurant and wanted to compare notes. I peeked my head out to make sure she wasn’t being a pest and was quickly waved off by the boss. Jordan was sitting comfortably on the sofa in his office, flipping through some of her coloring books.

I imagined I would have to leave the office early to take Jordan home, but we finished up at 6:30. When we got on the bus at the end of the day I asked Jordan if it was a good day. She said, “no, it was an excellent day.”

–

As a side note, Jordan will have her casts removed this afternoon. Her feet will be free at last. Physical therapy begins immediately and she has some special splints to wear while her feet learn to walk again. So far, everything is going better than planned. She’s looking forward to summer camp, when she aims to pass her swim test, ride a horse, and practice backward somersaults.

<p><br />Wednesday, the casts come off for good. She&rsquo;s ready. She walks everywhere, climbs stairs, hurls her legs around like they were loose clothing. I keep telling her that her feet are going to be stiff, and it will probably hurt to move around when her legs are fiberglass free, but she can&rsquo;t wait. She rolls her eyes and says, &ldquo;I know, Dad.&rdquo; On a walk home from lunch this afternoon I told her how proud I was of her &ndash; how she made everything look so easy. She said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s easy when you just do it. That&rsquo;s all there is, Dad. You just do it.&rdquo;<br /><br />Someone call Phil Knight.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She is so tall. The casts give her a half an inch, but still. When I watched her hobble around the kitchen tonight I was kind of dumbfounded. Where is my little girl? She is a young woman in the making&ndash;so mature, so lively, so lovely. I kind of lost my breath gazing on her as she parried with her mom and willed her way around the cupboards.<br /><br />We had a family dinner tonight at one of my favorite restaurants. I love these. We debate. We laugh. We argue and we disagree. And it&rsquo;s wonderful. Through it all, Jordan holds her own. In two short weeks, her casts will come off and she will be free. Every day she tries something new. Rehab will be easy for this one. And I will cheer her with eyes slightly wet.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-4593672383750807732?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/larryvincent/4436719775/" title="photo sharing" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4020/4436719775_70693321ef_m.jpg" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Purple Casts<br /><br />The good news&ndash;the fantastic, delightful, unsurprisingly intoxicating news&ndash;is that Jordan is healing well. Her doctor was very pleased with her progress. The X-Rays looked good, the stitches are out, and she&rsquo;s in blazingly purple casts. And &hellip; she can walk around now.<br />It was a very good day, except, as is often the case with Jordan, it was a day full of its own challenges.<br />First, Jeanette sent me pictures of Jordan&rsquo;s feet. I requested that she do this, naively thinking it would help me be there with them. It did. And it was sobering. The tracing number of incisions and the gruesome spectacle of the Frankenstein stitches emptied my lungs, and nearly my gut. True to form, Jordan didn&rsquo;t mind the scars so much, but she was incensed that the doctors drew on her leg with a marker (the surgeon&rsquo;s pen markings were still visible after nearly four weeks). Despite our discomfort at seeing the extent of the work done on Jordan&rsquo;s feet and legs, it didn&rsquo;t match the discomfort Jordan had to endure as they fitted her for her new casts. Her feet were very stiff, and the nurses had to really work and stretch her feet to get them into the right position for the next three weeks of casted mobility. I asked Jeanette if Jordan was in a lot of pain. She said that Jordan was quiet and cooperative throughout, except at one point she asked, &ldquo;how much longer will this take?&rdquo;<br />True to form, Jordan handled it all with remarkable poise. She was excited to get wrapped in purple and to be able to stand on her own. She said it felt funny when she placed her weight on her feet, but it hasn&rsquo;t stopped her from trying to walk around our home. She&rsquo;s loving the independence.<br />I love my daughter. I love her strength. I love her personality. I love the beauty she produces in the ugliest of situations. What I don&rsquo;t love is the unlucky straw she too frequently draws. Seeing the pictures of her poor feet cast a palor on most of my day. It was only matched by the voicemail I picked up from Jeanette. On the drive home, Jordan had a mild seizure. It was nothing to worry about, brief and only strong enough to check her out for a minute and slur her speech, but it was a seizure and those are always scary. I commiserated with Jeanette, who exclaimed, &ldquo;Really? Today? Can&rsquo;t we just get one thing a day?&rdquo; Jordan has very little memory of it, and she isn&rsquo;t complaining of a headache. Her feet hurt more today and she&rsquo;s loving the codeine-laced Tylenol again, but she&rsquo;s otherwise unsinkable. She doled out a lot of grief to her brother when he beat her at Wii. To listen to her litany of complaints, you&rsquo;d have no idea what she&rsquo;s been through today. And I suppose that&rsquo;s what makes this day a win, rather than a fail.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-1170116511076003869?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

Pain is seldom an issue anymore. She gets itchy, but she finds solace in Benadryl. She&rsquo;s very excited about Monday, when she goes in to have the first casts removed and the walking casts put on. As usual, we&rsquo;re all blown away by how she has handled the inconvenience of immobility.<br />Wednesday, she has another MRI, and our fingers are crossed that cancer is even further back in the rearview mirror.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-6120218455049696337?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><br />Jordan had a lot of fun with our good friend, Roger Holzberg. He helped her compile and edit her own video about her love of fashion design. She was focused today, and she had so much fun catching up with a kindred spirit. Later in the day, when we had lunch together as a family, she talked about what she&rsquo;d learned and how she wants to make more movies in the future.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Hangin&#039; with Dr. Feelgood</title>

She was on her way out, marching purposefully down the hall. She’d been poked and prodded and she was ready to go home–so ready that she walked well ahead of her mother who was still gathering belongings in the clinic. By the time Jeanette caught up with Jordan, she found her carrying on with a tall, Hollywood-looking man.

– What kind of music do you like, he asked.

– Ella Fitzgerald.

– Oh, man. Ella Fitzgerald is awesome.

– Yeah. And Peggy Lee.

– Peggy Lee? You listen to Peggy Lee? I know guys in my band who don’t know who Peggy Lee is. Who are your parents?

And just like that, Jordan was making friends with Nikki Sixx from Motley Crue. People told her who he was, but she was far more interested in the ways he thought about jazz and its influence on rock music. Nikki was roaming the halls of Children’s Hospital to cheer on the kids. He happened to find one who was less interested in his celebrity status and more interested in chatting the nuances of music with him. A few minutes later, she started singing lines from a Maroon 5 song. He told her he knew the band and they were all pretty cool.

That’s Jordan. She mixes with celebrities as easily as she mixes with family. She isn’t the least bit aware of their fame. She’s genuinely interested in sharing everything she can. And that’s why people fall hopelessly in love with her.

It was a long day with bits of good news. Jordan’s counts are way up. Her body is equipped again to fight infection. Because her headaches have been coming on strong lately, her doctor ordered a CT, just to be sure that her shunt was functioning. We were pleased to learn that the shunt is placed perfectly and her ventricles are actually in better shape than they were several months ago. The doctor also noticed that areas of her brain show signs of calcification. He told us that this is sometimes a sign that tumor is indeed dead. The tumorous tissue can’t calcify if it’s still active, he said. If this is true, it’s good to know that Jordan has conquered some of the disease. The flip side is that the calcification could be triggering the increase in seizures and the extra headaches. We’ll know more next week when she goes in for her next MRI.

While at CHLA, Jordan had a mild seizure. She had another today. Each was less severe than the seizure I wrote about over the weekend, but each takes an emotional toll on the patient and her family. Still, how cool is it that my daughter has met Nikki Sixx from Motley Crue? I’m not worthy.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Though I posted this morning, I wanted to share events that occurred about an hour after my update.<br /><br />The thud reverberated across the ceiling above me. I didn&rsquo;t need to think about what it was. I knew. I knocked the side table over jumping to my feet, scaling two steps at a time on the stairs.<br /><br />&ndash; Jordan! Jordan! Are you alright?<br /><br />There was no answer. Only the faint hum of the ceiling fan in the upstairs bathroom getting louder as I rushed upstairs. Fortunately, the bathroom door was not locked. Like any pre-teen, she values her privacy. Had that door been locked, I would have thrown my body against it to get inside.<br /><br />I found her trying to get to her feet, her legs splayed out with weak knees and most of her weight on her arm, trying to balance off the toilet. The other arm was trying to pull up her pants. But her eyes were dilated and her mouth crooked, the distinctive twitch from her lips that is the tell-tale sign she is in the midst of a seizure. I tried to talk to her but she could not speak. She could only gaze back at me with those wild eyes. She was in danger of falling again. I wrestled with her to get her to sit down, but even in the midst of a strong seizure her proper lady-like manners overruled. She kept trying to pull up her pants, unaware that she didn&rsquo;t have the motor function to get the job done. I spoke calmly to her.<br /><br />&ndash; Relax, honey. Let Daddy help you with those.<br /><br />She was shaking&ndash;not violently, but she trembled throughout her body. Her legs were covered in goosebumps. I asked her if she could say her name. Again, she looked back at me, clearly unable to speak at all. She shook her head no. I held her close to me for just a few moments, rubbing her back and stroking her hair. I asked her if she hit her head and she again shook her head no. Of course, she might not know. She doesn&rsquo;t remember most of what happens during a seizure. I told her I wanted to check her head just to make sure she was alright. She nodded approval. I ran my hands along her scalp and looked for any redness. The boom had been so loud. Now, I was shaking.<br /><br />I asked her name again. She tried to say it, but the sounds that spurted from her mouth were incomprehensible.<br /><br />At least two minutes had passed. The Ativan was downstairs. I would give her another minute  before I would run for it. It passed and she was still unable to speak. I have no idea how I managed to run up and down the stairs without falling. I just kept thinking that I need to get back to her. <br /><br />After giving her the medicine, I asked her name again. Nonsense from her lips. She motioned toward the shelf and managed to say something that sounded like &lsquo;purple.&rsquo; I looked up to see her hair brush. Surely, she wasn&rsquo;t thinking of brushing her hair. I pointed to things on the shelf and she nodded when my finger reached the brush. I handed it to her and she began brushing her hair. The motion seemed almost involuntary. She brushed and her lip pursed as though she were on the verge of crying. She brushed and brushed her hair, still unable to speak to me, still slightly shaking throughout her body.<br /><br />When she was done, she dropped the brush and sat with her back against the wall. I asked her name again. She tried to speak, but the words were far from familiar. I motioned for her to sit on my lap. She crawled over and leaned her whole body against me.<br /><br />&ndash; I&rsquo;m here with you, I said. I&rsquo;m here.<br /><br />I love the smell of her hair. It is laced with traces of her favorite shampoo, but there is also the beautiful scent of my daughter&ndash;the perfumed essence I first took in more than twelve years ago on the day she was born. With her head nestled against my neck, her scent surrounded me. I ran my fingers through her hair and I began to cry. I did not want to scare her, so I wiped the tears from my eyes as casually as I could without her noticing. When I&rsquo;d gathered my composure, I sat her up again and asked her name. The words she spoke began to sound like, &ldquo;Jordan,&rdquo; but they were short and garbled.<br /><br />After several minutes, we walked together to the bedroom. I laid her down and covered her with a blanket. She was getting better at saying her name, but the rest of her speech was a mess. When I asked her what channel she wanted to watch on the TV, she said &ldquo;Jordan Chaaa-.&rdquo; I asked again. Again she mixed a mangled &ldquo;Jordan&rdquo; into the words. I asked if she meant The Disney Channel. She nodded. With The Wiggles singing insanely in the background, I asked what show she was watching. &ldquo;The Jordans.&rdquo;<br /><br />Jeanette had returned from running errands. She knew the minute she entered the room what had happened.<br /><br />&ndash; How long?<br /><br />&ndash; Several minutes.<br /><br />&ndash; Did you give her the medicine?<br /><br />&ndash; Yes.<br /><br />Jeanette sat next to Jordan and ran her fingers over her cheeks. Jordan looked up at her. Jeanette asked her name. Jordan answered correctly. <br /><br />&ndash; Who am I?<br /><br />&ndash; Da-Mom.<br /><br />&ndash; Who is that?<br /><br />Jeanette pointed at me. Jordan turned, and for the first time her face lit up with a giant smile.<br /><br />&ndash; Daddy.<br /><br />I needed a break. My eyes were wet. I got up and grabbed a glass of water&ndash;splashed some on my face. When I returned to her, she had found more words, though every one of them was somewhat slurred because the right side of her face was still lagging in recovery. Every sentence sounded like it had been uttered by Cher. She was smiling more, laughing at the television, and beginning to provide the running commentary on life we sometimes curse. Not today. Each sentence, each observation; we encouraged her for more.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-2198097190027127760?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>She stopped me as I reached for the door with my travel bag over my shoulder.<br /><br />&ndash;Dad! Don&rsquo;t leave without giving your daughter a hug.<br /><br />She headed towards me, legs strutting, arms out-stretched. I set the bag down just in time for her to wrap her arms around me and press her head against my chest. Her hugs are gifted from the heart. I had half a mind to call off my business trip, stay with her and spend the rest of the day watching the Disney Channel; just the two of us resting in our pajamas, watching capers by beautiful teenagers who never worry about life with cancer.<br /><br />It is a difficult time for Jordan. In fact, it is difficult for us all. She missed school most of the week because her blood counts were down again. I have switched into strict anti-germ mode. I don&rsquo;t shake people&rsquo;s hands, and if I do, I immediately wash my own hands or saturate them in Purell. On the road, when I learned someone was sick, I moved as far away from them as I could. Every time I moved into a tight space, like an airplane or a meeting room, I worried; took shallower breaths; expedited whatever I could so that I could get out.<br /><br />Jordan has taken the news the hardest. When she told me about the results of her blood tests, she was somber and slightly whiny. She said she needed to work harder at slaying this cancer. She&rsquo;s been doing that a lot lately&ndash;beating herself up about her condition. We remind her whenever we can that she hasn&rsquo;t caused her cancer to return. She didn&rsquo;t do anything to lower her counts. In fact, we tell her, there is very little that she can do other than eat well, rest, and have a fighting attitude. I&rsquo;m not sure she understands. Jordan is a creature of self-reliance. She believes she wills what she wants.<br /><br />I hug her more and more these days. Sometimes, in my head, I imagine my hugs transferring vapors of health to her. I hold her for a long time, lean my head on top of hers, close my eyes, and let my mind wander to a place where Jordan is cancer-free&ndash;a place where she&rsquo;s running and reading and sharing gossip with friends her age. She seldom pulls away first. I seldom walk away with a dry eye. <br /><br />Two nights ago she came into our bedroom and complained of back ache. When we asked her where it hurt, she pointed directly at the spot where the tumor is growing, though we doubt she knew it. For Jeanette and I, it was a heavy revelation. Though the tumor has grown steadily, until now Jordan has had no symptoms. That&rsquo;s why her medical team was willing to avoid surgery. But lately, her back has been bothering her. She is also tired. Yesterday, after the USC game started, she excused herself to go upstairs. When I checked on her a half hour later I found her napping, buried deep beneath a canopy of blankets on her bed. She slept for hours. Chemo takes a lot out of her, but we worry more is at play.<br /><br />Jordan is worried about the scan she will have on the 27th. She talks about it often and she is open in telling us that it, &ldquo;freaks her out.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s had so many MRI scans we&rsquo;ve lost count. It&rsquo;s not the procedure that&rsquo;s troubling her. It&rsquo;s what they might tell us. We have decided it is best to prepare Jordan for the worst. In all likelihood, the tumor has continued to grow. She has only had two rounds of chemotherapy and no one knows if the tumor will react to this protocol. The doctors told us that it could take some time before we find the right mix and the tumor recedes. I worry that if the tumor has in fact grown, Jordan will take the news as further proof that she has failed. Absent Jordan&rsquo;s perfect health, I have only one wish for her: I want her to be happy. Throughout her Journey, she has weathered the most challenging setbacks because she loves a good laugh, because she loves adventure, and because she doesn&rsquo;t know how to do anything other than live life to its fullest. These past few days that attitude has faded somewhat. She reflects and frets about what&rsquo;s next. For the first time in her life, I think she pieces bits of information together and allows herself to wander into the same landscape of worries we consider every day.<br /><br />On Friday, we watched a crime drama on television together as a family. A suspect being interrogated by the lead cop wore a wig to hide the baldness caused by his chemotherapy. When he refused to cooperate with the tv cops, one of them said, &ldquo;like the wig you&rsquo;re wearing because of your terminal cancer. You&rsquo;re going to die, Mr. ___.&rdquo;<br /><br />Jordan was sitting on my lap. She started mumbling. Here&rsquo;s what I heard her say, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to die like my friend Jenna&ndash;because of his cancer.&rdquo; I could not make out the rest of the words. She was mumbling to herself, not really intending for me to hear. I had to wonder if she was drawing conclusions and relating to her own situation. It would be natural for her to do so, but unusual for a girl who generally thinks only about her capacity to win.<br /><br />We are blessed with many friends and loving family. Most of them encourage us to think good thoughts. And we do. But it doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that we are surrounded by somber realities. For the past six weeks, we have allowed ourselves to marginalize the beast nesting in Jordan&rsquo;s spine. She&rsquo;s being treated. She&rsquo;s handling it well. With those facts we cross our fingers and think positive. But the cold reality is that we don&rsquo;t know if the treatment is working. She is riddled with seizures. Her back is beginning to hurt. Her energy has dropped. All the positive thinking in the world won&rsquo;t make these facts dissipate. And pleasant thoughts don&rsquo;t calm a father&rsquo;s mind when he wraps his arms around his daughter and hopes there will never be a day when she doesn&rsquo;t hug back.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Though only slightly higher, Jordan&rsquo;s counts were improved today. She&rsquo;s allowed to go back to school on the condition that she washes her hands constantly. I would imagine that Jeanette will arm Jordan with a battery of hand sanitizer. At least the stir-crazy girl can get out of the house and get back into circulation. She&rsquo;s happy about that.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may have noticed that our site has a new look and feel. We made some improvements, but to do so, we had to pick up the whole blog and move it to a new location. All the content is there, although a few of the image links may need some maintenance. Also, if you previously subscribed to our RSS feeds or mail notices, you&rsquo;ll have to start again. But it&rsquo;s otherwise the same cast of characters you already know. Jordan is happy because the site is pink. She is also completely stir crazy.<br /><br />On Wednesday, when she went in for her weekly blood tests, we learned that her counts have dropped into the danger zone. A healthy kid will usually have an ANC of about 1,500. Once it drops below 500, the patient is considered neutropenic&ndash;meaning there may not be enough white cells to sufficiently fight infection. Jordan&rsquo;s ANC was 320.<br /><br />She&rsquo;s feeling just fine, but as a precaution, she can&rsquo;t go to school or go shopping or step outside and chat with the neighbors. She&rsquo;s under house arrest and it&rsquo;s driving her crazy. In turn, she&rsquo;s driving us crazy. We get frustrated with her because all she does it talk. But then we take a step back and try to imagine ourselves in her shoes. This morning I was happy to let her talk at me. And yes, it&rsquo;s at, not to. Every hour or so I give her a big hug and remind her that I&rsquo;m still her biggest fan.<br /><br />She heads back to CHLA on Monday. We&rsquo;re hopeful that the counts have started ticking back up. Under normal circumstances, she should be at the bottom of the bell curve. Most of the adverse symptoms of this chemotherapy protocol occur within the first two weeks. You&rsquo;d never guess she was deep into a chemo cycle by looking at her. She&rsquo;s radiant. Her hair has thinned, but she still has plenty of golden tresses to brush and primp. She&rsquo;s a little pale from being in, but she doesn&rsquo;t look ill.<br />I asked her this morning, &ldquo;Jordan, what&rsquo;s going through your mind these days?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ndash;The usual stuff.<br />&ndash;Refresh my memory.<br />&ndash;Fashion design. Candy. And I would like to go get the mail.<br />&ndash;There&rsquo;s no mail on Sunday.<br />&ndash;But you didn&rsquo;t get it yesterday.<br />&ndash;It&rsquo;s just junk and bills.<br />&ndash;But I like to get the mail. If I wash my hands can I get it?<br />&ndash;Why are you so set on getting the mail?<br />&ndash;Dad, it&rsquo;s just how I entertain myself.<br /><br />So, I let her go. We sanitized her hands when she was back. She sorted through all the junk mail and circled some pictures in a J Crew catalog. If that&rsquo;s how she wants to entertain herself, go get &lsquo;em, girlfriend.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-8165269706607906793?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I haven&rsquo;t posted for awhile because life has kept me busy. And unfortunately, this will be a brief entry. Jordan went in for her second round of chemotherapy last week. While she handled it with the same fighting spirit we&rsquo;ve all grown to love, her counts are down this week. In fact, she&rsquo;s neutropenic, which means we&rsquo;ll need to keep her out of school and limit exposure to the world around her for a bit until her immune system recovers. She heads back to CHLA on Monday for another round of blood tests. Her next MRI is scheduled for October 27th.<br /><br />I promise to post more soon.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-3353708582835354568?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nearly 60 of them shifted in their seats as she stood front and center, brushing her hair out of her face with the back of her hand. Five dozen fifth grade boys and girls listened as best they could to the smiling sandy blond before them.<br /><br />&ndash;OK, I want to tell you about some stuff that is happening to me.<br /><br />And then she told her classmates about cancer and the new tumor and chemotherapy and how she might lose her hair and how she&rsquo;s going to wear scarves because she shopped at Nordstrom with her dad and how she uses her iPad when she gets the new chemo. She shared it all and answered questions.<br /><br />&ndash;Does it hurt when they use the needle?<br /><br />&ndash;Well, it hurts for a little bit &hellip; but only for a minute.<br /><br />&ndash;Do they poke you in the arm?<br /><br />&ndash;No. They use my port.<br /><br />She pulled her shirt collar down and showed them.<br /><br />&ndash;See this bump? That&rsquo;s my port. That&rsquo;s where they poke me when I get chemo. And it doesn&rsquo;t hurt as much as when they poke me in the arm.<br /><br />Then a boy told her that his mom had breast cancer and had chemotherapy. He said she lost her hair, but it grew back. And Jordan told him she knew how he felt because she knew someone who had breast cancer, too. It didn&rsquo;t strike her as odd at all that she empathized with him by speaking of another survivor instead of speaking of herself.<br /><br />Her teachers suggested that she address the class and share her experience. Knowing that Jordan would soon lose her hair, they thought it might help to prepare the class&ndash;to share a chapter from her life so that they could understand the coming changes. Jordan didn&rsquo;t bother to share the experience with us until a couple of days later, somewhat matter-of-factly. When I asked her how it made her feel, she told me it was alright. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good that they know,&rdquo; she said. When I asked her if talking about it made her feel uncomfortable, she shot back, &ldquo;why would I be?&rdquo; And I had no answer.<br /><br />She is beginning to lose her hair. It isn&rsquo;t noticeable, but her brush is filling up with more wispy strands of flax than usual. Blond strands are accumulating on her shirts and on her pillow. It occasionally makes her melancholy, but she moves on quickly. Yesterday morning she approached me in the kitchen.<br /><br />&ndash;Dad, tell me if you agree with mom or no?<br /><br />It&rsquo;s never good when she asks me these questions. I know, of course, that Jeanette has vetoed something.<br /><br />&ndash;I told Mom that I want to shave my head today. Do you think that&rsquo;s a good idea?<br /><br />She was backlit by the morning light, and all I could see in the silhouette was a thick muss of hair. It looked more golden than usual in that light&ndash;and none of it appeared thin. I paused for a minute because I couldn&rsquo;t really process what she just said to me.<br /><br />&ndash;Sweetheart, why would you shave your head today?<br /><br />&ndash;Because my hair is falling out, Dad. You know, when it starts to fall out you shave it.<br /><br />I really didn&rsquo;t mean to laugh. It wasn&rsquo;t funny. She was aware of the hair taking leave and she was doing what some suggested was a good solution. But she was also jumping the gun.<br /><br />&ndash;Honey, you don&rsquo;t have to shave your head. That&rsquo;s only if you want to, and you should only really consider it when enough of it has fallen out that it&rsquo;s noticeable. Some people do it because they&rsquo;d rather not have bald spots or patches of thinness. But you still have a full head of hair. I don&rsquo;t think you should shave it today.<br /><br />She sized me up for a moment and let her eyes dart around the room.<br /><br />&ndash;Okay. If you think so. So, you agree with mom?<br /><br />&ndash;If mom told you to wait, then yes, I agree with mom.<br /><br />&ndash;Can we have some tea?<br /><br />And she was on to the next subject.<br /><br />She is doing well, coping well, and looking well. She returned to school on Tuesday and bid farewell to the summer. After attending opening day, she missed Wednesday to visit the hospital and have blood work done. Her counts are very strong, a relief to everyone. Next week she&rsquo;ll step up her schedule and start visiting the clinic twice a week for blood work. And the week after she is scheduled to receive another dose of Cytoxan.<br /><br />Nagging somewhere in my mental ether is the dreaded realization that October is merely a few weeks away. Though we ended the October curse in 2007,  I&rsquo;m superstitious and the present cosmic conditions are not ideal. Hope, however, rests with the girl. She&rsquo;s found a dose of serenity. That&rsquo;s not a metaphysical assessment. That&rsquo;s the only way I know how to describe her mood.<br /><br />If she is afraid, she shows no sign of it. Every day she surprises me with outbursts of maturity. It&rsquo;s breathtaking to watch her in action. Jordan gets it done. She commands her soul to crest with the waves of misfortune instead of turning over to them. That&rsquo;s not to say she&rsquo;s a perfect angel. In fact, she drives us all crazy at times. A soul with that big a will can challenge the calmest of nerves. But I, for one, am inspired by how she navigates the rough seas of reality. She&rsquo;s willing to shave her head when it&rsquo;s adorned with beautiful blond tresses and prepared to share her experience in front of naturally judgmental pre-adolescent minds. Summon your dictionary and lookup &lsquo;bold&rsquo;, there may be a picture of Jordan embedded in the copy.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-5324254328703815755?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/larryvincent/4958938990/" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4086/4958938990_89bf750e0e_z.jpg" title="Jordan_2257" alt="Jordan_2257" width="425" height="640" /></a><br /><br /><br />In all the years I&rsquo;ve known her, I&rsquo;m not sure she&rsquo;s ever looked so good. Maybe it&rsquo;s the healthy glow from a thriving summer. Maybe it&rsquo;s the blossomy aura of a young lady growing up. Or maybe it&rsquo;s the confident air of survivor gearing up to take on life&rsquo;s challenge again. Whatever it is, it agrees with her. She is radiantly beautiful. It&rsquo;s not just her physical appearance&ndash;the tan, the way she wears her fashion, the streaks of blonde in a wild swirl of wispy hair&ndash;it&rsquo;s her way. She is agreeable, chatty, charismatic. You want to be with her and she wants to be with you.<br /><br />Saturday afternoon, as the mild summer sun set on Santa Monica, I sat with her on our patio playing a game of dominos. She set her weight on her right elbow as she tapped at the bone white pieces. Twice she bested me. Now, her eyes squinted on her three remaining blocks, eyebrows furrowed deep in contemplation. I was down to one.<br /><br />&ndash;You might win this one, she said, but I&rsquo;ll beat you next time.<br /><br />I had a double that I could play on my own leg, but I had to draw from the bone pile and the block didn&rsquo;t work on any open leg. I had to put my penny up, too.<br /><br />&ndash;That&rsquo;s okay, Dad. You might still win.<br /><br />That&rsquo;s my girl: competitive and compassionate. We played a few more rounds and Jordan emerged the victor when it was through. She relishes every win when we play&ndash;probably because I show her no mercy. You might think I play bad hands to make her feel confident, but you would be wrong. I play to win, and every time she makes a bad move I make her pay for it. She wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way.<br /><br />But it isn&rsquo;t the competitive strategy that makes our domino games so enjoyable. We chat while we play. We munch on finger foods. We take in the sun. We play to pass the time and enjoy each other&rsquo;s company. These are the moments when I truly appreciate how much I love her. For all her ferocity and all her determination, she makes a great companion on a holiday weekend.<br /><br />One week has passed since she restarted chemotherapy, and she is doing great. She went in for blood work Thursday and her medical team was thrilled with her progress. Her counts look absolutely normal&ndash;no fluctuations at all. We don&rsquo;t expect her stats to stay this way. She goes back on Wednesday, and we are prepared to see a decline. But I sleep easier knowing that she is handling treatment with such grace and strength. Sometimes I think we ask too much of Jordan. We require her to be strong, to persevere. I believe she would be strong and persevere even if we didn&rsquo;t push her to do so&ndash;it&rsquo;s who she is. But I have to remind myself on days like Saturday that the caricature I so often portray&ndash;the girl with the will of an ox&ndash;has another side. She fusses over her strategies. She yearns to live carefree. She loves nothing more than spending time with people she loves. My goal in the days ahead is to help this slayer spend more time doing these things.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-4975968935693879996?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One week after restarting chemo, her counts are fantastic. Her medical team was aptly impressed by how well she&rsquo;s doing. Her Irish liver is stepping up again. That said, her counts are still expected to drop next week.<br />She looks and feels great, and for that we are very happy.<br />The big news of the day was the scene Jordan made at CHLA wearing her new, signature t-shirt. It&rsquo;s one of several she received from family friend Ron Peterson, co-founder of <a href="http://bayvi.com/" target="_blank">BayVI</a> sports apparel. Every shirt is graced with her name in larger than life type, and the descriptor: the slayer. She absolutely loves them. She attracted quite a bit of attention and interest from staff and fellow patients alike.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-1656503035995718066?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I miss the phone call by one ring and look down to see that Jordan was the caller. When I pickup the voicemail, the commentary is immediate. No &ldquo;hello&rdquo; or useless pleasantries.<br /><br />&ndash;Dad, when I lose my hair my friend says I should use your clippers to shave it off, so I&rsquo;ll make a deal with you. I will shave my head if you will shave your face. Love, your daughter, Jordan.<br /><br />Now, for a bit of background. In two days, Jordan begins chemotherapy. The protocol includes drugs she hasn&rsquo;t had before, and it is extremely likely that one of the drugs will cause her to lose her hair. In the past, we were advised that she might lose some hair, but this time the team told us that it would be a complete fluke if she didn&rsquo;t lose nearly all of it. So, we&rsquo;ve prepared her for what&rsquo;s sure to come. She has handled it surprisingly well. As proof, re-read the first few words of her message to me. &ldquo;Dad, when I lose my hair&hellip;&rdquo; She doesn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;if&rdquo; anymore.<br /><br />Her &ldquo;friend&rdquo; is a counselor who has been working with her to prepare for the next phase of treatment. She explained to Jordan that a lot of times the hair doesn&rsquo;t fall out all at once. It often separates from the scalp in clumps. She told her that a lot of kids choose to use clippers to trim it all off when the clumps start falling. When Jordan says &ldquo;shave&rdquo; she really means that she wants to use my clippers.<br /><br />And the last bit of explanation has to do with my grooming habits. I hate shaving so I often let the stubble grow. I can&rsquo;t seem to grow much of a real beard, so I use the clippers to keep myself in a steady state of inbetweeness. Jordan has never been a fan of this look.<br /><br />&ndash;You just don&rsquo;t look like you, Dad, she tells me.<br /><br />She doesn&rsquo;t like it when she &ldquo;gives me sugar&rdquo;&ndash;her favorite way to describe the way she kisses me on the cheek. This explains her simple proposal. If she uses the clippers to trim her hair when chemo sets in, I have to properly shave my face. I call her back immediately to accept her terms. I also start shaving immediately as a gesture of goodwill. I am rewarded by a frequent stream of sugary cheek pecks.<br /><br />Our family is apprehensive about Thursday. This will be the first of two infusions spaced roughly three weeks apart. She&rsquo;ll spend the day in the outpatient clinic while they monitor her progress. The drugs will probably make her nauseous and we expect that her white blood cell counts will drop dramatically within a few days. For this reason, she may not start school with the rest of her class in a couple of weeks.<br /><br />I suppose there is no good time to start chemo, but if you can let your mind consider such an idea, this week is perfect. Jordan is coming off of a summer high point. She returned from camp a little over a week ago looking sun-kissed and rosy. She passed her swimming test and spun tales of camp shenanigans for days. As if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, she celebrated her birthday last weekend. Her Aunt Lisa and Uncle Ricky flew down from Oregon to help her toast 12 years. They ventured to Disneyland on Saturday with one of Jordan&rsquo;s great friends, and then we feasted on El Cholo Sunday afternoon. To top it all off, she received an iPad as her main present. We conspired with several friends and family members to buy it for her. She was completely surprised and summarily described it as, &ldquo;the best birthday present EVER.&rdquo;<br /><br />Seizures have come and gone, but she is mostly riding on the fumes of good health and a great attitude. This is the happiest and the most vivacious I&rsquo;ve seen her in years. So, in that sense, it is a great time to begin a new regimen. She has her own indomitable spirit on her side. And if I have to make a deal with her now and then to sustain her momentum, so be it.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-8348891539917577752?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jordan did well at her MRI yesterday. As we suspected, the tumor has grown again. It was 11mm in March, 15mm in June and it is now estimated at 19mm. Most likely as a result of its increased size, we are also seeing swelling on the upper part of her spine. All of which tells us we must act.<br /><br />Fortunately, the LA and Chicago-based oncology teams agree that we should hold off on surgery due to the risks. When Jordan returns from camp next week she will begin a new chemotherapy regimen. It&rsquo;s somewhat experimental but early results with similar cases have been promising. We will try two cycles of this protocol and then see if it has slowed or reduced tumor growth. If it has, we&rsquo;ll keep at it. If not, we&rsquo;ll switch to another protocol.<br /><br />Since we have elected against surgery, there&rsquo;s really no reason for Jordan and I to travel to San Jose today, but she did not want to cancel a trip with Dad. So we&rsquo;re headed up to visit some of the museums and spend a day together, just she and I. Tomorrow she heads to camp.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-8894641136841085209?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

A few minutes later she thumps down the stairs.<br /><br />&ndash;Get out of here, give me some money, too.<br /><br />She sings along, missing several words but trying to carry the tune. Just as she&rsquo;s getting it, she interrupts herself.<br /><br />&ndash;Dad, is this Peggy Holiday?<br />&ndash;Peggy Lee.<br />&ndash;She really is a good singer.<br />&ndash;I&rsquo;m a fan.<br />&ndash;Yeah, now I&rsquo;m going to do some push-ups.<br /><br />She walks over to a corner of the room and begins doing push-ups. Push-ups! It&rsquo;s 10pm.<br /><br />&ndash;Jordan, why are you doing push-ups?<br />&ndash;I just feel like doing them.<br />&ndash;Okay.<br /><br />She finishes her routine about the same time that the music changes. Now, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;All That Jazz&rdquo; from the Chicago soundtrack (yes, I was immersed in jazz and showtunes). She doesn&rsquo;t know this one, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop her from honky-tonking around the room until something in her switches.<br /><br />&ndash;This is how we do tree pose.<br /><br />And, she&rsquo;s doing yoga&ndash;showing me how. She tries to hold her balance on one foot. It is not successful, but she wobbles a few times to get it right. She turns to me and smiles broadly and I smile back.

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We play games when we gather for dinner, especially when we eat out. We began the practice several years ago to prevent the incessant quarrels the kids would start when left to their own conversations. Word association games are our favorite. Jordan is quite good at these. I think it is the truest sign of her intelligence. Though her brain starts and stutters over matters of common logic, she can string ideas together with an uncommon and poetic wit. When she played along at dinner Tuesday night, seated at a small table at Rosebud&rsquo;s on Rush, &ldquo;blue&rdquo; evoked &ldquo;Billie Holiday&rdquo; and she associated &ldquo;ocean&rdquo; with &ldquo;miracle.&rdquo;<br /><br />It doesn&rsquo;t take long for a word association game to get old, so we mix in other variations. The kids favor a new game we invented where one player provides a few clues about a movie and the first one to guess the title gets to go next. This game has a limited shelf life because Jordan has limited cinematic knowledge&ndash;but she loves the game. When we had exhausted her set of film titles, we moved on to the either/or game. I think this game is the most interesting in our arsenal because it reveals what people value. You play by providing stark contradictions and asking a player to state which they prefer. For example, I might ask you if you prefer to have great artistic ability or incredible physical strength. The rationale people provide is what makes it interesting. But Jordan struggles with this game. Even though she is known for being head-strong and a do-or-die provocateur, she hates to make choices when the field is nuanced. Ask her to choose a favorite television star, iCarly or Hannah Montana, and she&rsquo;ll tell you she likes them both. Add the condition that she can only take one of them with her to live on a desert island and she will tell you it&rsquo;s a silly question and that she&rsquo;d prefer to take them both.<br /><br />Nevertheless, while we waited for our food to arrive, we decided to give either/or another try. We chose a counter-clockwise rotation, which meant that Jeanette asked Jordan her questions and Jordan asked me hers. The first time around, Jordan asked me, &ldquo;Happy or sad?&rdquo; I laughed and briefed her on the big idea again. I asked her who would choose sad over happy?<br /><br />&ndash;So which one do you pick, Dad?<br /><br />&ndash;Happy.<br /><br />She listened as we circled the table again. Luc asked a real-thought provoker of Jeanette, which slowed us down a bit, but Jordan&rsquo;s turn came soon enough and I found her leaning toward me.<br /><br />&ndash;Live or die?<br /><br />&ndash;Live, of course! Jordan! I&rsquo;m not sure you&rsquo;re getting this game.<br /><br />&ndash;I am, Dad! It&rsquo;s just a question.<br /><br />She rolled her eyes as we provided some examples of how she might rephrase that question: live long without a penny, or die young and very rich.<br /><br />&ndash;Got it, Dad.<br /><br />&ndash;Do you want to keep playing?<br /><br />&ndash;Yes.<br /><br />And so the questions again circled the table, and again it was Jordan&rsquo;s turn. We coached her a little more. The smile on her face said she had a great question for me. Her left eyebrow arched wickedly, implying that I might have to think about this one.<br /><br />&ndash;Dad, prison or a nice hotel?<br /><br />She laughed right along with us, as if she knew that her question was absurd. Maybe she did. Maybe she didn&rsquo;t. It was good to see her laugh. We had traveled for hours and then drifted around the city trying to find a place to have dinner. We wanted deep dish pizza, but every place we went had a wait of an hour or more, and we were famished. Though Rosebud&rsquo;s is a tourist trap, we got in quickly and the food was tasty.<br /><br />Sitting around that cramped little table, we all tried to ignore why we were in Chicago in the first place. I think we fooled ourselves to believe this was just another family vacation&ndash;a vacation to one of our favorite destinations. But the reality of the next day lingered in our heads. We were here to gather information. A decision loomed, and the reconnaissance we were about to gather promised to guide us in that decision.<br /><br />By 8:30 the next morning, each of us fidgeted in the waiting room at the oncology clinic at Children&rsquo;s Memorial Hospital. The vacation illusion had evaporated. We were surrounded by children who were traveling their own journeys with cancer&ndash;hairless children, thin children, children crippled by the disease. We flew more than 1,000 miles to find ourselves sitting in a room so very familiar to us. Our escapist whims were arrested by the jarring hubbub of families engaged in the good fight, and we were reminded that our family was very much at war.<br /><br />Jordan required very little time to become irritable and impatient. She complained about how long it took for us to see the doctor. She whined about being bored. She expressed her dissatisfaction at the comparative size of the play room. She jumped from activity to activity with staccato movements, nervous ticks and punchy statements. Luc hunkered down and played with his iPhone until its battery was exhausted. Then he zoned out with a book. Meanwhile, Jeanette and I felt every bit as anxious. We moved around, shifted in our seats, and occasionally comforted the other with a brushed hand or a brief moment of eye contact. That is, when we weren&rsquo;t chasing after Jordan. We half feared that she would just abandon us and head out the elevator to the street. The scenario was perfectly believable if you knew Jordan and knew how her mind worked when her anxiety peaked to this level.<br /><br />The docent who greeted us told us that we won the award that day for traveling the farthest. Like everyone we met at the hospital, she made us feel incredibly welcome. Perhaps that is why the scene felt so familiar. Like Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, Childrens Memorial was staffed by the saintly. In fact, part of the reason we had to wait awhile to see the doctors was because they wanted to give us their full attention. And that they did.<br /><br />Stuart Goldman is a warm teddy-bear of a man, who enjoys sharing corny jokes with the kids he looks after. If you met him on the street, you might never guess that he is one of the world&rsquo;s best neural-oncologists. He looks more like everybody&rsquo;s favorite high school teacher&ndash;a man with a warm smile and kind, listening eyes that disarm you with their empathy and sincerity. When he met with the three of us (Luc opted to stay in the waiting room), Jordan told him a joke. She had been advised to do so by Dr. Goldman&rsquo;s fellow, but the joke was her own.<br /><br />&ndash;Why don&rsquo;t elephants smoke?<br /><br />Dr. Goldman glanced back at one of the attendings, then winked at us as he prepared to take the bait.<br /><br />&ndash;Why don&rsquo;t elephant&rsquo;s smoke. Hmm. I don&rsquo;t know. Why?<br /><br />&ndash;Because their butts are too big for the ashtray.<br /><br />Dr. Goldman laughed out loud and told his team that was a good one. He was going to use it in his rotation. His fellow told Jordan she probably had no idea how much Dr. Goldman would tell that joke. &ldquo;Now, he has new material. Thank you, Jordan.&rdquo;<br /><br />She smiled and some of the tension went away. She cooperated with Dr. Goldman as he examined her. Here and there, the impatience returned. She moaned about wanting to get out of this place and go shopping. Dr. Goldman told her he thought that sounded like fun, and he excused her to go play in the playroom again, if she wanted. She did, and thus began the first difficult conversation of the day.<br /><br />Dr. Goldman began by saying that he was impressed with Jordan&rsquo;s strength. If he had read the case history without examining her in person, he wouldn&rsquo;t have imagined that Jordan was as emotionally vibrant and physically strong. He was also struck by how strong her legs were, given that she had recently had surgery to split her tendons&ndash;and also given the location and size of the new tumor in her spinal cord. He told us, as others at CHLA have told us, to look at her scans you would expect a child who was already showing signs of trouble&ndash;loss of leg strength, partial paralysis, and difficulty controlling her bowel and bladder function. Knock wood, Jordan hasn&rsquo;t really demonstrated any of these symptoms.<br /><br />Like Dr. Finlay, Dr. Goldman would prefer to have a tissue sample from the new tumor. He reiterated Dr. Finaly&rsquo;s primary concern: this disease can change gears from low grade to high grade. The only way to know is to look at a biopsy. If we understand the histology of the new tumor, we are better equipped to formulate a therapeutic regimen. But, to get that tissue sample, the neurosurgeon has to perform a surgical biopsy of the spine, and that procedure is very risky. It is very likely that Jordan would have less lower body function after surgery than she has today. If she were already showing signs of this functional decline, you might argue that surgery is worth it. But when you see what she can do, you have to ask whether or not the surgery is a risk worth taking.<br /><br />Dr. Goldman started to share his thoughts on alternatives, but not before reminding us about something we already knew&ndash;but it never hurts to hear again.<br /><br />&ndash;You should know that you are in very good hands. Dr. Finlay is one of the finest doctors in this field in the world. He pioneered many of the regimens we use every day to treat our patients. I know exactly why he is recommending a biopsy. I would probably give you the same recommendation. As an oncologist, we want specifics on the tumor before we recommend treatment. And this tumor isn&rsquo;t easily defined. I&rsquo;m sure you know that it&rsquo;s pretty rare.<br /><br />We discussed the treatment options he might consider if we opt out of surgery. First, we have various chemotherapy protocols. Because Jordan had a severe reaction to vincristine, a drug that is included in many of these protocols, our team may have to adjust the plan&ndash;adding to the uncertainty of treatment expectations. We discussed one of the plans Dr. Finlay has suggested, a new approach that was only recently introduced in Europe with some success. We also discussed the San Francisco regimen, a mixture of chemotherapy agents that has been used successfully in the treatment of neuroglial tumors, but includes vincristine as one of its four agents.<br /><br />Then we discussed radiation. It has its own set of risks, but it has also been used with some success. Dr. Goldman discussed the possibility of full cranial and spinal radiation treatments vs a focused radiation treatment on just the new nodule. The risks of radiation are further cognitive decline and the elevated possibility of secondary malignancies.<br /><br />Finally, we discussed the possibility of using biologicals&ndash;experimental new drugs that use genetic technologies to fight the disease. These therapies have limited track records, but offer promising potential. In theory, they could be very effective, but there is insufficient data to know if they might work. If they don&rsquo;t, the tumor could get larger while we wait and see.<br /><br />On Wednesday afternoons, the head of the neurosurgery practice also visits the clinic, so the Children&rsquo;s staff suggested that we go grab some lunch and return later to meet with Dr. Tomita. When we told Jordan we weren&rsquo;t done we were met with an agonizing groan.<br /><br />&ndash;Dad, I want to get out of this place and go do some shopping.<br /><br />&ndash;I understand. But remember, we came all this way for a reason and it wasn&rsquo;t to spend money on Michigan Avenue.<br /><br />&ndash;I just want to be done with this.<br /><br />We found a pizza place and ordered deep dish. When it arrived, Jordan rejected it immediately because the sauce was on the outside and the cheese was on the inside. Jeanette explained that&rsquo;s how deep dish is made.<br /><br />&ndash;Just try it. You like cheese.<br /><br />She eventually tried it and admitted that it was delicious. Halfway into our pie, Jordan and Luc lobbied to play another word game. I really didn&rsquo;t have the energy to play one and I was distracted by so many conflicting thoughts about Jordan&rsquo;s latest step. We came all this way and instead of answers, my mind was filled with more questions. This was a good thing. In fact, Dr. Goldman advised us to take some time and write down our questions so that we could further discuss Jordan&rsquo;s case when we returned. With all these questions racing through my mind, a word association game wasn&rsquo;t very appealing. Jordan insisted. And so we spent the early afternoon playing &ldquo;who am I?&rdquo; a game where one player leaves the table, the others conspire over who he/she is, and then the player returns and can ask six yes/no questions to figure out who they are. Jeanette did not guess that she was Elizabeth Taylor. I guessed that I was Darth Vader. Before we knew it, it was time to make our way back to the hospital.<br /><br />It took plenty of cajoling to coax Jordan into the exam room to meet Dr. Tomita, a sage-looking Japanese man who spoke with measured, broken English. Despite her cross attitude, Dr. Tomita softened Jordan up and charmed her to cooperate with him. I sat to her right, and when Dr. Tomita asked her to follow the light with her eyes, I noticed the nystagmus in her eyes&ndash;the involuntary movement of her pupils that looks like restless twitching when she looks all the way to the side. I have only recently learned that this is the result of nerve damage, probably caused by the pressure build up when she had hydrocephalus. When Dr. Tomita had finished his exam, we let Jordan go back to the playroom.<br /><br />Using the paper that draped over the exam table, Dr. Tomita drew a pencil sketch of the spinal column and showed us where her tumor was growing. He sketched the likely surgical path, which requires a cut through the spine and into the cord. He explained why the surgery was full of risk. Because it is such a small space and so many nerves are compacted in the region, any cut risks damage to healthy tissue. He said that when he looked at her scans he expected to find her with limited lower body function or the onset of symptoms. But like Dr. Goldman, he was surprised by her strength. After talking with him for awhile, Jeanette and I were having serious reservations about surgery&ndash;reservations that Dr. Tomita understood and supported.<br /><br />A few minutes after we thanked Dr. Tomita and sat with our thoughts, Dr. Goldman and team returned. We discussed the options again and Dr. Tomita&rsquo;s observations. The neuro-oncology team and the neurosurgery team would meet the next day to discuss Jordan&rsquo;s case in greater detail and call us with an official opinion, but we were all leaning away from surgery. Dr. Goldman asked us if we had questions, and of course we did. We asked about the risks and side effects of the various treatments. We asked about the risks of not doing surgery. And then we asked about success rates. I told Dr. Goldman that I had extremely high confidence in Dr. Finlay. I trust him implicitly, I told him.<br /><br />&ndash;You should, he said.<br /><br />&ndash;I&rsquo;ve gotten to know him over the years, I said, and he&rsquo;s what I would call a passionate optimist. And I love that about him. The glass is always half full, and he always has multiple options baking in his head. He likens Jordan&rsquo;s condition to a chronic disease, like Diabetes. But I need to know, how serious you think Jordan&rsquo;s disease is? I realize it&rsquo;s a loaded question, but if I&rsquo;m deciding whether or not to go ahead with such a risky surgical procedure, I have to balance her quality of life. I have to understand what kind of battle we&rsquo;re fighting.<br /><br />Dr. Goldman had been standing, leaning back against the wall. A moment after I asked the question he smiled and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to grab a chair, because you ask a very good question and we should spend some time talking about this.&rdquo;<br /><br />He retrieved a chair from the hall, sat down across from us, and began. As Dr. Finlay told us, Jordan&rsquo;s cancer is very rare and there aren&rsquo;t as many documented cases as you will find with other brain tumors. We are dealing with a lot of unknowns. Like Dr. Finlay, Dr. Goldman considers himself an optimist. He is impressed by Jordan&rsquo;s strength and by the way she has handled seven years with the disease. But he told us he may have a slightly less optimistic outlook for Jordan&rsquo;s case. That didn&rsquo;t mean we had to give up hope, but it did mean that we had to understand that her disease is quite serious. It is life-threatening. Though it is low grade, the disease has been known to shift gears. And, even when it is low grade, if a tumor develops in the wrong place, it&rsquo;s still dangerous. For example, the new tumor has the capacity to cause paralysis. And in the long run, the disease certainly has the capacity to take her life.<br /><br />&ndash;I think you should know that we have lost children to this disease. But you should also know that I think great work is being done to fight it, and our goal should be to keep Jordan healthy long enough so that we can find a cure.<br /><br />It was hard to breathe. Jeanette&rsquo;s eyes were red, and I imagine mine were, too, though neither of us cried. I cannot explain the emotions. They pent up for the rest of the week, looking for some kind of release. Maybe I&rsquo;m not dealing with it, or maybe I&rsquo;m afraid of what might happen if I just let go, but whatever the reason I feel this pressure inside. At moments like the conversation with Dr. Goldman, the pressure reaches a cusp. I flirt with the idea of breaking down and unwinding every fear, anxiety and tension, but I never do. I hold it in, much like Jordan does. I grab what molecule of strength I can find and I make it work like ten.<br /><br />I am very grateful to everyone at Childrens Memorial. We live in an amazing world where gifted, compassionate people like Dr. Goldman and Dr. Finlay serve children. Dr. Goldman acknowledged how hard these conversations are, and he reassured us that it was good to ask such questions. He also encouraged us to keep asking them and to keep supporting our strong cancer slayer. The team in Chicago was as charmed and inspired by our daughter as the team in Los Angeles is. As difficult as the conversation was, I am stronger because of it, and I am somewhat relieved to know what I know. I asked Jeanette about this, and she felt the same way. Though I can&rsquo;t say this is the news we wanted to hear, it is news we needed to hear, and the hearing of it gave us strength. I couldn&rsquo;t help but think of Jordan&rsquo;s either/or question. Live or die? She chooses to live, and it shows in everything she does. Living is a verb, but it is a verb we don&rsquo;t completely control. Right now, we have no control over Jordan&rsquo;s cancer. In a matter of days, we will decide how to try and retake control. Every option is riddled with risk, but our primary consideration for each option will be to determine how much it lets Jordan live. How much the option will allow her to exercise the verb.<br /><br />We split up next the day. Jordan and Jeanette returned to Los Angeles on an early morning flight. Luc stayed in Illinois with me to accompany me on some ethnographic interviews I had scheduled for a client. At the airport, as I said goodbye to the girls, I gave Jordan a giant hug and I reached the cusp again. Just feeling her in my arms put me at the breaking point again, and saying goodbye, though only for a day, pushed me to the edge. I held it together, eyes welling up, inner voice coaching me to find an anchor. It didn&rsquo;t take long.<br /><br />&ndash;See you tomorrow, Dad.<br /><br />She&rsquo;s never been good at goodbyes and she had no time for sentimental nonsense. She was ready to board her plane and go home. I kissed Jeanette, watched the two girls disappear into the security line, and walked with Luc to the rental car shuttle. We spent the next 24 hours together, driving across beautiful rural Illinois, walking corn fields with knowledgable farmers, and comparing playlists on our iPhones. Every now and then, we&rsquo;d laugh about Jordan&rsquo;s either/or responses. When the conversation would lull, one of us would say, &ldquo;prison or a nice hotel?&rdquo;<br /><br />Thursday, Jordan and I fly to San Jose so that we can visit a well-known neurosurgeon at the Children&rsquo;s Hospital at Stanford University. We&rsquo;ve asked his opinion on the surgical option. He is considered one of the leading authorities on surgeries of this kind. After consulting with him, our family will gather to discuss the options and make our choice. But not before Jordan enjoys a full week away at the Ronald McDonald camp, or before we dine together again to play another round of word games.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She lives for costume changes. On an average day she&rsquo;ll switch outfits two or three times. Early this afternoon she ditched a blouse and airy summer skirt for the comfort of a USC t-shirt and cotton shorts. As I walked past her room a few minutes ago I noted that she had added knee-high, rainbow-striped Juicy Couture socks.<br /><br />&ndash;Nice socks, I say.<br />&ndash;Thanks.<br /><br />She sits hunched over, engrossed in her sketches, alternately rifling through colored pencils.<br /><br />&ndash;What are you up to?<br />&ndash;Just doing some artwork.<br />&ndash;Will I get to see when it&rsquo;s done?<br /><br />She stops for just a minute to look at me like I&rsquo;m crazy. She rolls her eyes and shakes her head as if I am the silliest person she&rsquo;s ever seen.<br /><br />&ndash;Yes, Dad.<br /><br />And then she&rsquo;s back to work.<br /><br />You&rsquo;d never imagine that she was in the midst of serious health discussions, that she was about to travel over 1,000 miles to see new doctors, or that she will soon plow headfirst into painful surgery or new rounds of chemotherapy. And that&rsquo;s just the way Jordan likes it. She&rsquo;s a free-spirit&ndash;a near-teenager with quirks and attitude and plenty of creative ways to occupy her time.<br /><br />We head to Chicago Tuesday. We have a meeting with one of the world&rsquo;s leading pediatric neural-oncologists. Our mission: assess the risks and benefits of spinal surgery. We have learned a lot about these risks and benefits in the last week. Jeanette and I met with the team at CHLA on Thursday. It was enlightening. I have said it before, but it&rsquo;s worth repeating. We are blessed that Jordan has access to these wonderful souls who care for her and work so hard to keep her healthy. Her neuro-oncologist and her nurse care practitioner have watched over her from the very beginning and we have come to think of them as part of the family.<br /><br />Here&rsquo;s the situation. The tumor in Jordan&rsquo;s spine grew nearly 4mm in 3 months. It&rsquo;s still small, but that is the fastest progression of the disease we have seen in the five years since she was diagnosed. The problem is that we don&rsquo;t know if the tumor is of the same variety as the tumors that riddled her brain or if it is something new. It is possible to treat it with chemotherapy, but if this tumor is a new flavor, the therapy we use may be ineffective, and tumor progression in the spine can be very dangerous. That&rsquo;s why the LA team would prefer to get a biopsy&ndash;to learn what we&rsquo;re dealing with. As I noted in an earlier post, spinal surgery is full of its own risks. So we find ourselves weighing two options: surgery or aggressive chemotherapy. Whichever option we choose, her team here is supportive and has a plan of action ready to go.<br /><br />Yesterday, Jeanette and I called a family meeting. We gathered round our dining table in the early afternoon to talk about the road ahead. I asked the family, &ldquo;why are we going to Chicago?&rdquo; Jordan was the first to answer.<br /><br />&ndash;To get an opinion.<br />&ndash;Right, I said. But why do we need an opinion.<br />&ndash;So that we know what we should do.<br />&ndash;Sort of. In a couple of weeks we&rsquo;re going to have to make a decision. We need to decide whether or not you should have surgery. It&rsquo;s a big decision.<br />&ndash;No surgery!<br />&ndash;Before you decide, let&rsquo;s talk about what&rsquo;s going on.<br /><br />We spent the next hour talking about risks and benefits. We even used flip charts and a white board. Luc was very helpful in drawing pictures to illustrate concepts (because Jordan can&rsquo;t read). It was a transparent conversation. We discussed the serious risks&ndash;the risk that she might not be able to walk again or go to the bathroom on her own. Naturally, Jordan did not like this, but she kept the conversation going. We gave every member of the family a domino. If the conversation grew too uncomfortable, anyone at anytime could throw their domino over and we&rsquo;d break. Jordan loved this. We even practiced turning the dominoes. I&rsquo;m happy to say that we got through the whole meeting without one domino turned.<br /><br />We spent a lot of time reviewing history, from the time Jordan was symptomatic to the present. Both kids were engaged. I was actually overwhelmed by how well they remember the big steps on Jordan&rsquo;s Journey. We used those moments in history to explain what has been going on in Jordan&rsquo;s body. I think this really helped Jordan understand.<br /><br />When we had finished the meeting, I apologized to the whole family. I told Jordan that I may have set her up for unrealistic expectations. You see, back in 2004, about an hour after the CHLA team briefed us on Jordan&rsquo;s disease, we sat down with Jordan and told her she had cancer. She was six, and I remember thinking even then that she was remarkably brave. She was sad, but even then her optimism was astounding. I told her that she was going to have to kick cancer&rsquo;s butt. That phrase stuck. Ever since, she has told anyone willing to listen that she was kicking cancer&rsquo;s butt. It was a badge of honor.<br /><br />I told Jordan that I set her down the wrong path, because I led her to believe that she could beat it once and be done with it. I know now that was the wrong approach. Jordan&rsquo;s cancer is very rare and only recently documented in medical research. From the little that is know about it, her medical team believes her cancer is a chronic disease. That is to say, we should all expect and hope that Jordan will be an old woman one day. But we should also expect that throughout her long life there will be periods when she must focus on fighting the disease again. We should condition ourselves to think of it like diabetes. There may be times when she may have to resume chemotherapy because that is the nature of this chronic disease. Treatment may be a way of life. But we should hope that life can still be long, and rich, and full of hope.<br /><br />I told Jordan it was time for a new story. I flipped open my laptop and showed her a slide of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I asked her if she ever saw the television show. She hadn&rsquo;t, but she knew the basic story. I showed her a couple of other pictures from the show and I told her that Buffy was very good at killing vampires. In fact, she was born to take them out because she&rsquo;s a slayer. No matter how many vampires Buffy kills, new ones show up. Sometimes, the vampires are pretty nasty and we end up watching 2 or 3 shows to see how Buffy does. But Buffy doesn&rsquo;t stop, she just keeps on taking out all the vampires, and she&rsquo;s never alone. She has a team of friends and family that support her while she rids the world of vampires. I told Jordan she should start thinking of herself like Buffy. It&rsquo;s not about kicking cancer&rsquo;s butt one time. She&rsquo;s going to keep taking down tumors because that&rsquo;s what she was born to do. She&rsquo;s a slayer.<br /><br />It took a minute, but she smiled. It was a lot for a kid to hear, but true to form, Jordan handled it well. When the family had dispersed, I asked Jeanette how it went and we both agreed that it was a good talk. Both kids participated and we all knew our roles for the trip. We eliminated a lot of the unspoken bits of truth, but it never got too heavy. Jeanette told me she thought Jordan took to the slayer analogy.  And I did, too. It may have been a bit extreme, but I&rsquo;d rather my daughter think of herself as a slayer instead of a survivor. If there&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;ve always admired about Jordan, it&rsquo;s the way she fights. There&rsquo;s nothing fragile about it, nothing hesitant. She fights with vengeful vigor. That&rsquo;s how she conquered the monster in the first round, and it&rsquo;s how she will fight it on the road ahead. And one day many years from now, she&rsquo;ll tell her grandchildren that she&rsquo;s no ordinary grandmother. She&rsquo;ll tell them that she has super powers. They&rsquo;ll lean in to listen more closely, and she&rsquo;ll tell them about her born destiny&ndash;her destiny as a slayer. With each twist and turn in her story, those kids will see in their grandmother the very strengths and eccentricities we have come to know and love. And she will tell them just as proudly as she tells us that she has kicked cancer&rsquo;s butt &hellip; several times. And she&rsquo;s ready to do it again.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-2052007965172546155?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was a good week for the girl. She was extremely anxious about starting radiation, but after her first treatment she realized it wasn&rsquo;t so hard and it took less time than chemo. She&rsquo;s holding up well. She asked me to take her to her photography class today. It was great to watch her play with photos. She has a genuine interest in the subject and she&rsquo;s taking some beautiful shots. I&rsquo;ll post some soon.<br /><br />She&rsquo;s still not so sure about the purple ink on her face, but she seems less self-conscious. She doesn&rsquo;t wear a hat anymore and she isn&rsquo;t very shy about mixing up with strangers. We have scheduled a fantastic photo shoot for next weekend, and she&rsquo;s pretty excited. She&rsquo;s also excited because this Tuesday she will probably appear in an episode of Glee. She was one of about eight patients who were invited to shoot a sequence with Jane Lynch and Matthew Morrison a few weeks ago. She had a GREAT time on the set at Paramount Studios and she&rsquo;s pretty pumped up about the possibility that she&rsquo;ll see herself on television this week. It doesn&rsquo;t hurt that she also is a big Gleek.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-1129683831657562082?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

She’s a bit self-conscious. It’s an unusual state of being for her. In preparation for radiation therapy, the technicians have drawn several alignment guides on her face, neck and abdomen … in permanent ink. She is not allowed to wash them off. In fact, the marks are covered by clear adhesive tape to prevent fading. And when they fade on their own during the next six weeks, they’ll be redrawn again because they provide critical information to ensure that the beam of radiation hits the right spot. That’s right, she’s going to have purple ink lines on her face for the next six weeks. She’s handling it well, but she wore a hat to school today. She told me she was afraid the other kids would make fun of her.

I previously posted that the process would begin on Tuesday. I was only half correct. While technically, the process begins Tuesday, she won’t receive her first dose of radiation until Wednesday. Tuesday is a simulation designed to see if Jordan can get treatment without sedation. If she can hold still on her own for the two-minute test, we’ll proceed without the drugs. It is obviously very important that she remain still.

Once the treatment begins, continuity will be essential. The whole process is choreographed to ensure she receives the optimal amount of radiation to affect the tumor – and that means she won’t be able to skip days. Even if her blood counts drop, the team will suspend chemotherapy and order blood transfusions before they suspend radiation therapy. This will create a new burden for Jeanette, as she and Jordan will be making the cross-town commute in mid-day LA traffic more often than usual.

We’re mostly ready. We’re slightly anxious. And we’re all staying optimistic. I feel bad that Jordan is worried about how she looks. Throughout her long journey with the disease, she has always maintained phenomenal self-esteem. After brain surgeries she would proudly show her stitches and scars to anyone who’d give her an audience. When her hair was thinning she wore it well and didn’t hesitate to tell people how glad she was that she kept most of it. But today, she wanted to hide and she was worried about what people might think. I told her to think of the ink like war paint. She always liked Pocahontas, so I told her to imagine she’s following the tradition of the Native American people. She’s painting her skin to scare the cancer away. I also told her that no matter how much they mark her up, she’s the most beautiful girl I’ve ever seen – more beautiful than Pocahontas or any other princess out there. And she is.

[P.S., I asked Jordan if she would mind me sharing a photo of her in her war paint. She said, “why not?” and gave me a nice thumbs up signal when I pointed the lens her way.]]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jordan begins radiation therapy this Tuesday. She was fitted on Friday and proud of herself because she didn&rsquo;t need sedation (some patients find it difficult to control the gag reflex when the mold is created for the mouth-guard). She called me to tell me that she received a new blanket from the CHLA team (her third).<br /><br />&ndash;Sweetheart, I&rsquo;m glad it went well &hellip; but you already have two blankets.<br />&ndash;Well, they told me I could have another one.<br />&ndash;Is it nice?<br />&ndash;It&rsquo;s so cool. I can&rsquo;t wait for you to see it.<br /><br />Because the tumor is in a sensitive part of the spine, she will receive a small dose of radiation about every day for six weeks. She <em>will</em> have to be sedated for each session because healthy tissue could be damaged if she moves the slightest bit. Fortunately, each dose lasts for only 2 minutes, so she won&rsquo;t be out for long.<br /><br />Jeanette and I are cautiously optimistic about the new chapter on Jordan&rsquo;s Journey. We keep telling ourselves it&rsquo;s going to work. On the other hand, we worry about the consequences if it doesn&rsquo;t. Jordan can only receive six weeks of radiation therapy. After that, any additional radiation to the spine could be dangerous. That means, if it doesn&rsquo;t work, we&rsquo;ll have to revisit the subject of surgery or perhaps some very aggressive chemotherapy drugs. Right now, we&rsquo;re trying to stay positive and we&rsquo;re hoping for good news in six weeks.<br /><br />Some of you have asked why I haven&rsquo;t posted much. I am at work on a big writing project and haven&rsquo;t had much time to update you all. Rest assured that Miss J is her usual self and I&rsquo;ve kept my notebook handy to jot down some of her unique moments to share with you soon.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;I made this for you.&rdquo;<br /><br />She handed me a piece of gray construction paper cut into the shape of an elephant. <br /><br />&ldquo;Are you trying to tell me something?&rdquo;<br /><br />She didn&rsquo;t get the joke. Instead, she smiled and pointed out the lovely purple border she&rsquo;d hand drawn, and the glittering stars she had affixed to its back.<br /><br />&ldquo;I made it for you, my lovely, Daddy &hellip; but one of its eyes fell off. I have to glue it back on when I find it.&rdquo;<br /><br />I looked down at the one-eyed elephant and felt kind of bubbly inside. Jeanette tells me that Jordan deliberately went back to the play room at Childrens Hospital to fetch this heart-felt piece of craft work. When she found the play room closed, she insisted that an aid open it up so she could get the art she made for her Dad. And people wonder why I am so smitten!<br /><br />Jordan is about to start a new course of treatment: radiation. For the next five weeks she will report to CHLA five days a week for a two-minute dose of focused radiation. It will be supplemented with an oral chemotherapy regimen&ndash;a drug she has had before. We expect minimal side effects, and we hope that the focused stream of particles to be beamed into her spine free her of the latest insurgence by the disease. We did have a bit of good news today. After 16 months, the tumor in her brain appears dormant. It&rsquo;s only the 1 inch mass in her spine that&rsquo;s challenging us now&ndash;that and the shift in anti-seizure meds. <br /><br />She&rsquo;s had some nasty seizures over the last couple of weeks. It is to be expected, but the sudden increase troubles her and it&rsquo;s certainly hard for us to watch. She had one Sunday. She felt it coming. When she told me, I had to remind her to sit down. When she sat, it was as if a switch in her brain flipped. She let herself go and I watched her slip away from me. Her body twitched but her eyes looked straight ahead. Her pupils widened until it seemed all her eyes were black. When I spoke to her, there was only the faintest bit of acknowledgment that I was there, and honestly, I probably imagined it. I held her hand, stroked her hair and spoke quietly to her as her right side spasmed. As usual, when she finally returned to us, she was exhausted. She napped for a few hours, and when she awoke she had no recollection of the seizure. I hope one day her memory is as absent when she is asked to recall all that she has been through with cancer.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Coping with Reversals</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyvpm15sxM1r5aaue.jpg" /></p>
<p>In a story, there&rsquo;s nothing so pleasing as a good reversal. The reversal is the moment in the story where the hero&rsquo;s life takes an unexpected turn. In a comedy, it&rsquo;s often what causes us to bend over with laughter. In a drama, it&rsquo;s the moment in the story where our heart feels like it has moved to our throat. Reversals provide cathartic moments that give a story momentum and engage us with the stakes our hero must respect. <br /><br />In real life, reversals can be agonizing. It&rsquo;s one thing to empathize with a character on stage or screen. It&rsquo;s quite another to be that character, to experience a sudden change that engages you with the stakes of life.<br /><br />Yesterday, Jordan&rsquo;s MRI revealed that the tumor has grown again. Between her scan in November and the scan today, it grew 1.2mm in size. Compared to the rapid growth it demonstrated in the spring and summer, this growth was stunted. But it has grown and Jordan&rsquo;s risks are increasing. Though no definitive course of action is yet determined, it is likely that we will switch to another chemo protocol and radiation is being discussed for the first time on her journey. The tumor board at the hospital meets Tuesday, where her case will be discussed and a therapeutic protocol will be determined.<br /><br />Jordan is aware of the reversal. She took it somewhat in stride, as she so often does. She told me there was good news and bad news. When I asked her to tell me the good news first, she said she couldn&rsquo;t remember it. Then she told me, &ldquo;my tumor grew again.&rdquo; I hugged her and told her I was sorry.<br /><br />&ndash;Yeah, but they&rsquo;re going to give me a new chemo<br /><br />And then it hit her.<br /><br />&ndash;Oh, yeah. Dad, that&rsquo;s the good news.<br /><br />She laughed at this and I stepped back and marveled at my cancer slayer. While Jeanette and I were both feeling so down and so defeated, Jordan was making jokes about her predicament. She later sat with us and watched television while pecking at her iPad. She waxed chattily about her favorite movie stars on the People&rsquo;s Choice Awards and multitasked by listening to some favorite tunes while playing a round of Angry Birds.<br /><br />Until yesterday, our lives were trucking along beautifully. We all had a restful holiday. We&rsquo;ve been having work done to the house. I&rsquo;ve been making progress on my book project, and life at work is thriving. The reversal that came my way via a text message from Jeanette at 5:20pm pacific time was quite unwelcome. I felt my mood deflate like a slow leak in a tire. As I sank into a funk, I got angry with myself. Jordan has faced many challenges and setbacks during her 8 year journey. We should be accustomed to them by now, but they still shock me and leave me emotionally spent. My head skips forward to so many circumstances that don&rsquo;t yet exist. I begin preparing myself for pain only to turn around and see Jordan laughing and carrying on as though life were an invitation to look for fun. Jordan&rsquo;s Journey is full of reversals, but the one constant upon which I can always rely is the optimism, the faith, and the spirit of my daughter. <br /><br />We don&rsquo;t know what to expect in this next chapter. Chemo has taken a lot out of her over the past several months. She&rsquo;s thinner and so is her hair. One of the chemo protocols being discussed requires a 3-day hospital stay. The radiation she might receive is administered in 2 minutes doses every day for several weeks. I&rsquo;m sure there are side effects, but of course we are more interested in the potential outcomes. I have steadfast confidence in her medical team, and I have a strange flow of hope in light of the bad news because my family is strong and Jordan is resolved to win. As in storytelling, reversals reveal the true nature of the characters who encounter them.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Her counts are low again, and she had to get another shot of GCSF. She was not pleased with the shot part. She may need a few more. She&rsquo;s been fatigued, but she still has her personality. I&rsquo;ve been on the road all week. Still, I get calls from her to ask how I&rsquo;m doing. She has the most lovely tone when she calls. When I ask how she&rsquo;s doing she&rsquo;s always nonchalant. Last night, when she realized she called me during a client dinner she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s good to hear your voice Dad and I miss you, but call me after your dinner.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s sweet when she&rsquo;s concerned about me. Little does she know I&rsquo;d make any client wait to hear about her day.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What a day! There was style and fashion and delicious treats and an abundance of kindness. How&rsquo;s that for a day?<br /><br />Jordan and several of her friends from Children&rsquo;s Hospital were invited to spend the afternoon at <a href="http://www.cristophe.com/" target="_blank">Christophe Beverly Hills</a>. Christophe is known for styling the locks of beautiful women and men, rock and celebrity royalty, and politicians alike for over twenty years. The whole event was hosted by the Everlasting Smiles Foundation. Jordan was in heaven.<br /><br />The event couldn&rsquo;t have come at a better time. Chemo has taken a toll on Jordan&rsquo;s beautiful head of hair. It&rsquo;s been thinning and she has refused our suggestions to have it trimmed because she likes longer hair. When this invitation came through though, she was only too happy to let a celebrity stylist cut it shorter, make it look fuller, and blow it out so that some might easily confuse her for a Disney Channel star.<br /><br />There is something to be said for the &ldquo;kindness of strangers.&rdquo; I am struck by the generosity of Christophe and his crew. They welcomed all these children into their salon and treated them like royalty. Jordan came home positively brimming with pride. She even let me take some photos of her in her new style. Also posted here are beautiful photos Jeanette took throughout the event.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tomorrow she will have chemo again.<br /><br />She&rsquo;ll rise early, stretch before getting out of bed, and quietly make her way to the &ldquo;lady&rsquo;s room.&rdquo; There, she will brush her hair methodically. As she looks in the mirror, she&rsquo;ll notice how much that hair is thinning. She&rsquo;ll focus her attention on her brush strokes, with concerted brows that look as though they&rsquo;ve been over-plucked. Her eyes will lock onto her wrists as she runs the bristles through, and she&rsquo;ll dare the hair to defy her. When she sets the brush back on the shelf it will be full of defectors, but she&rsquo;ll go about her business and pay no mind to her head&rsquo;s ungrateful former tenants.<br /><br />She&rsquo;ll come downstairs, take her breakfast worth of pills, and wash them down with a cup of tea and a glass of cranberry juice. And then, she&rsquo;ll climb into the backseat of our Jeep and make her way to Children&rsquo;s Hospital, while listening to a playlist of Ella Fitzgerald and Britney Spears. She&rsquo;ll challenge her mom to guess which of four elevators will arrive before making her way up five floors, checking in at triage, and waiting for fluids to pump into her veins so that the sweet poison can follow. She&rsquo;ll only complain that the day moves by too slowly. And when it&rsquo;s time to come home, she&rsquo;ll rest and laugh and fill our ears with random observations excerpted from a chatty commentary on life.<br /><br />Tomorrow, she will have chemo again.<br /><br />I&rsquo;ll go to work.<br />Luc will go to school.<br />Jeanette will mother, nurse and ferry.<br /><br />Tomorrow, Jordan will get it done. Again. <br /><br />News cycles will flow. Holiday shoppers will acquire gifts. Football fans will discuss the Patriots. Life will swirl around us while my girl gets it done. She&rsquo;ll make it seem so easy &hellip; so effortless. The best fighters always do. <br /><br />To the Get-it-done Girl. Godspeed!</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jordan is having a wonderful time this week with our family in Portland. On Tuesday, her Auntie Lisa and Uncle Ricky brought her into the city to hang out with Jeanette and I. To clarify, the kids are staying with family and Jeanette and I are staying downtown at a hotel. It&rsquo;s a much-needed mini-vacation for me and my wife. <br /><br />Anyway, during Jordan&rsquo;s visit downtown, she sweet-talked her uncle into playing some pool with her. She got a few good lessons and enjoyed the whole experience. Here are some photos from our trip and the day.</p>

<p>A little more than 24 hours from now, we will herd the family and the dog onto a plane for a long overdue vacation. We&rsquo;re headed to Portland, Oregon to spend the Thanksgiving holiday with our extended family. Jordan is very excited.<br /><br />It has not been an easy couple of weeks. After Jordan&rsquo;s last dose of Cytoxan, her counts dropped dangerously low. Fortunately, she seems to have resilience at the cellular level. A few days after she went neutropenic, her white cell counts and ANC began to rise again. Her immune system has regained its strength and it shows.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the seizures have become more frequent. One day earlier this week she had four seizures in the same day. As a result of this neurochemical instability, she has been reluctant to go outside, go to school, or do anything where she might suddenly feel &ldquo;that funny feeling.&rdquo; You can imagine how excited we all feel about boarding a plane.<br /><br />The neurologist adjusted Jordan&rsquo;s prescription and it seems to be working. In the last two days she has occasionally felt the pre-seizure feeling, but felt normal again within a few minutes. We&rsquo;re keeping our fingers crossed. <br /><br />None of the setbacks have quelled Jordan&rsquo;s excitement about traveling. Like me, she loves to fly. She&rsquo;s not very happy that we&rsquo;re requiring her to wear a face mask, but she hasn&rsquo;t made too much of a fuss because she knows it&rsquo;s a fairly short couple of flights and the payoff at the end is a long visit with her family.<br /><br />After the hustle and bustle of the last several weeks, Jeanette and I are eager to shift gears and wind down. The time spent with family will be fantastic, but we&rsquo;re also carving time out for the two of us to check out from the journey and recharge our batteries. We are unapologetically planning to veg.<br /><br />Every year at this time, we are reminded of how lucky we are to have so many loving friends and family with us on Jordan&rsquo;s Journey. We are grateful to all of you who have sent us encouragement and love from so many corners of the world. Thank you for reminding us that we are not alone. Thank you for cheering us on. Thank you for finding your own ways to wish for Jordan&rsquo;s good health. <br /><br />Of course, we are most thankful for the amazing doctors, nurses, volunteers and medical support teams who provide Jordan with such excellent care all year through. It is tragic that every day so many children battle the demons of pediatric brain cancer. But there is a legion of people who work tirelessly to keep them healthy, and without those good folks, Jordan wouldn&rsquo;t be here today. If you are looking for a cause this holiday season, please join us in supporting your local Children&rsquo;s Hospital. <br /><br />Happy Thanksgiving.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Midway through the day, Jordan called me from Children&rsquo;s Hospital, where she was having her weekly blood work.<br /><br />&ndash; Dad, I got two shots and I didn&rsquo;t cry!<br /><br />&ndash; Two, shots! Why did you get two shots?<br /><br />&ndash; Oh, I had to get a flu shot and a shot to help my body make more white blood cells.<br /><br />There wasn&rsquo;t the slightest bit of concern in her voice, only pride at her accomplishment. I hadn&rsquo;t seen the two text messages Jeanette had sent me; the first to tell me Jordan&rsquo;s counts were very low and the second to tell me she was getting a dose of GCSF to boost white cell production from her bone marrow. I didn&rsquo;t need those texts. I had already pieced it together in my head and my heart kind of sank. Nevertheless, Jordan brought me right back up.<br /><br />&ndash; Hey, Dad. Will you do a favor for me?<br /><br />&ndash; Sure. What?<br /><br />&ndash; Can you go into my Facebook and tell people that I got two shots and I didn&rsquo;t cry? Because I want to be healthy for Thanksgiving.<br /><br />I was only too happy to oblige. I&rsquo;ll get the full download tonight. This is the expected consequence of Jordan&rsquo;s chemotherapy protocol. We expect it, but it&rsquo;s never very comforting. We now go back to becoming germ-phobic. Jordan&rsquo;s ANC is below 500, and her white blood cell count is dipping but her pride is over-abundant.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Something wasn&rsquo;t right.<br /><br />We thought it was because we were hungry. It was past noon and most of the house hadn&rsquo;t eaten a thing. We&rsquo;d reached that moment in time where it was too late to have patience and fix something. We wanted food now. Jeanette kept asking me what we should eat. I deflected and asked what she had in mind. She was coy.<br /><br />&ndash; I want something hearty.<br /><br />&ndash; Like what?<br /><br />&ndash; A burger would be good.<br /><br />&ndash; I could go for a burger, too.<br /><br />I stopped short of recommending our favorite restaurant. I wanted this to be her idea. She didn&rsquo;t take the bait. After further deliberation I caved.<br /><br />&ndash; How about R&amp;D Kitchen?<br /><br />&ndash; Can we really afford to go out?<br /><br />&ndash; Oh, please! You want to go there, too.<br /><br />She agreed. It took a full 30 minutes more to get the kids rounded up. R&amp;D is one of favorite spots. It wasn&rsquo;t a matter of getting the kids inspired. Instead, we had to hunt for shoes, make sure hair was combed and rustle everyone to get out the door to the end of the block.<br /><br />But when we sat down, something still wasn&rsquo;t right.<br /><br />The appetizers arrived. Jeanette and I had fresh glasses of wine. The kids had pop. <br /><br />Still, something wasn&rsquo;t right.<br /><br />When Jordan excused herself to go to the restroom, we knew. She said nothing, just got up rather abruptly, excused herself politely, and trudged out of sight. Jeanette and I made the briefest eye contact before she followed Jordan down the hall. Somehow, we both knew. Jordan was seizing. The two ladies were gone for only five minutes. Luc and I made idle chit chat. My head was somewhere else. He knew something wasn&rsquo;t right just as well as I did.<br /><br />Away from us, down the hall, Jeanette intercepted Jordan in the ladies&rsquo; room. Jordan could not speak. Her eyes were distant. Jeanette spoke to her. Jordan nodded, but she had no words. Lately, when the seizures come on Jordan ramps up defiance. She insists on standing. She is restless. Jeanette does everything she can to distract her and convince her to just sit out the convulsions. Jordan has a mind of her own. In the throes of the seizure Jeanette kept cursing herself for not bringing her purse along. The Ativan was in the purse.<br /><br />Meanwhile, back at the booth, my stomach turned somersaults. I kept wondering whether I should head down the hall to check on the girls. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably nothing,&rdquo; I thought. Luc tried to make conversation. His eyes belied his casualness. He watched my every move. Then I saw the girls heading back to the table. Jordan had that distant absence in her eyes and Jeanette told me all I needed to know with one glance.<br /><br />Jordan sat next to me. At first, she could not speak. Her right side twitched. I asked her name. She just shook her head. Eventually, she struggled to make sounds. There is nothing&ndash;nothing at all&ndash;more emotionally moving than watching her in these moments. She is fighting&ndash;fighting with every synapse in her head. She is trying to break through. Her chin is down. Her brows are knitted. She is going to speak. She is going to snap out of this. She does everything she can to wrestle control over her mind. I sit helplessly and speak as gently to her as I can.<br /><br />&ndash;Jordan, I&rsquo;m right here, honey. I&rsquo;m right here.<br /><br />Every time we go through this, I react differently. It&rsquo;s always emotional. Today, I was strong. I kept it under control. I was able to whisper to her, hold her hand, and smile. It wasn&rsquo;t until she started to come out of it that the emotion ran over me. She started to cough. She didn&rsquo;t get sick, but she did spit up. In the mix of it all, Luc asked if he could be excused. I brushed a tear away when I made eye contact with him and I was able to pull it together when I told him, &ldquo;of course, Scout. Take as much time as you need.&rdquo;<br /><br />Luc took a quick stroll outside, gathered his composure and came back to find us behaving as though everything was normal. Jordan was still only half with us, but to an outside observer we were just another family enjoying Santa Monica&rsquo;s best food. Slowly, slowly, Jordan&rsquo;s vocabulary resurfaced. By the time we had paid the check she was mostly back to normal, though she still struggled to form sentences. When we got home, I had to convince her to rest&ndash;maybe take a nap.<br /><br />Every doctor tells us that the seizures are harder on the parents than they are on the patient. She doesn&rsquo;t feel anything, they say. She doesn&rsquo;t even remember them. I don&rsquo;t worry that she is in pain, but I do lament her absence. No science fiction movie can capture the horror of the zombification. She is right there in front of you, looking as radiant as ever, but somehow gone. Then there&rsquo;s the fight going on inside that you can just sense. She&rsquo;s pushing it back, willing her mind to settle down, clawing her way back to consciousness. And you want to do everything you can to help her, but the only thing you can do is tell her you&rsquo;re there. As a parent, it&rsquo;s absolutely debilitating.<br /><br />When she was back with us, her fist instinct was to occupy her mind. She whipped out the iPad and started playing Solitaire. Playing is a soft way to describe her action. She manipulated the game with obsessive compulsion. I coached her, happy to converse with her in any way imaginable. I think the more she successfully played her hand the more she knew she had beat the seizure back. Watching her move cards around with such determination, I leaned over, kissed her on the forehead, and reminded her &hellip; &ldquo;I will always be right here with you. Always.&rdquo;</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-6153779766686353263?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Jordan recommenced chemotherapy yesterday. We&rsquo;re scheduled for two more rounds of Cytoxan, then another scan near the holidays to see if we&rsquo;re making progress. Jordan handled the dose yesterday like a pro.<br /><br />After seven years, I still found myself swept away by little moments with big impact. Yesterday, before they disconnected Jordan from all the tubes, she said, &ldquo;I think I might have a headache tomorrow, Mom. Maybe I can&rsquo;t go to school.&rdquo;<br /><br />We push Jordan a lot, but we&rsquo;re generally willing to let her take a day off from school the day after chemotherapy. Jeanette didn&rsquo;t react to Jordan&rsquo;s prediction that she would be feeling poorly the next day.<br /><br />This morning, when Jeanette went in to wake Jordan she predictably said she didn&rsquo;t feel well. Jeanette let her rest for a bit before broaching the question again.<br /><br />&ndash; How do you feel? Do you think you might be able to go to school?<br /><br />&ndash; My tummy hurts, mom.<br /><br />&ndash; OK. Do you want to rest for a bit more? Remember, it&rsquo;s a short day. (She had a doctor&rsquo;s appointment in the afternoon)<br /><br />Jordan rolled over and rested for another 20 minutes. Then she appeared in our bedroom doorway &ndash; dressed for school.<br /><br />&ndash; Mom, can we stop at Starbucks on the way to school?<br /><br />When Jeanette sent me a text message telling me that Jordan went to school today, I had to stop what I was doing and just admire my daughter. I can&rsquo;t explain how proud I am of her in moments like these. Such strength. Such determination. Such pride. I sent Jeanette a reply.<br /><br />&ndash; Wow! She&rsquo;s going to school. She&rsquo;s my hero.<br /><br />A minute later Jeanette replied.<br /><br />&ndash; She says, &ldquo;thank you, dad. That makes me feel so good inside.&rdquo;<br /><br />That makes two of us, kiddo.</p>]]></content:encoded>

 What a night! Jordan attended the <a href="http://pablove.org/galleryshow2011/" target="_blank">Pablove Shutterbugs Graduation Show</a> this evening. Two of her photographs were included in the featured collection. They were also available for sale, and she was very proud that her prints sold out quickly.

</div>
Everything about the evening was perfect. The kids walked down a red carpet and had their pictures taken in Hollywood style as they arrived. A DJ spun great tunes as survivors and celebrities mingled around the Kopeikin Gallery, admiring the work of inspired Shutterbugs. Jordan gave an interview and proudly shared insights on her photos. It was a sublime experience that was fun, emotional, and inspiring. Our family is so grateful to all the good folks at Pablove: Jo Ann Thrailkill and Jeff Castelaz, Shutterbugs founder Cath Berclaz, and Jordan’s terrific teacher, Kate. Good souls who made a great cause possible. Please join us in supporting this program. Jordan was part of the inaugural class, but she hopes (as do we) that many more cancer slayers have the opportunity to discover their creative voice through the power of photography

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chalk another one up for our cancer slayer. The radiation worked! The tumor in her spine decreased from 25mm to 17mm. The doctors are very pleased. We&rsquo;re very pleased. Our circle of friends is very pleased. It&rsquo;s exactly the outcome we hoped for. Jordan took it all in stride. While we talked with Dr. Finlay and celebrated success, all Jordan cared about was getting out of the hospital so she could go to Denny&rsquo;s (a restaurant that neither Jeanette nor I care for much). <br /><br />I have a lot to share, but can&rsquo;t today. Writing a book is much harder work than I remember. When I get a break, I have to share some great stories&ndash;like the celebrity encounter she enjoyed yesterday. It was pretty special and I&rsquo;m pretty much a tease. More to come soon. Tonight, our whole family celebrates our tough hero. Onward!</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-1173630448178161508?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

She&rsquo;ll continue to take chemotherapy until the next MRI, which is scheduled for April 20th. She&rsquo;s doing very well. I&rsquo;m posting this great photo from the Shutterbugs graduation day. Three of Jordan&rsquo;s photos are posted on <a href="http://www.pablove.org/shutterbugs/photos/" target="_blank">their website</a>. Have a look and see the beautiful photographic perspectives of all the children.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-8355302425957234650?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OK. So, we clearly had technical difficulties on the last post. I will reformat and post for those who wanted to see Jordan&rsquo;s photo narrative and my mini-documentary of her making it.<br /><br />I also have much to write about &hellip; but not today. I&rsquo;m racing toward deadline on my next book and I&rsquo;m kind of out of words.<br /><br />But! I will share this little tidbit. Jordan, Jeanette and I went last night to see Never Say Never, the Justin Bieber biopic. (Luc elected to sit this one out.) Jordan loved the film, and it wasn&rsquo;t just a mild crush on the Bieb. She loved every bit about the movie &ndash; his energy, the thought of rising from obscurity to social media phenom, the drive to do something when other people say, &ldquo;no way.&rdquo; At the end of the movie, when the Bieb starts singing the title track, Jordan turned to me and said, &ldquo;Just like me. Never give up.&rdquo;</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-1790736258303938920?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was a magical day. Not because a portfolio session was underway, nor because Jordan looked so beautiful. It was magical because there was so much love. This day was designed for Jordan to <em>feel</em> beautiful. It was meant to reconnect her with her amazing strength. And it was intended to remind her that she was not alone. It achieved all three objectives.<br /><br />Honestly, this is not my best photographic work. I made a ton of amateur mistakes. But I&rsquo;d gladly make them all again because in some ways the photos don&rsquo;t matter. The girl you see in the photos&ndash;the real Jordan&ndash;that&rsquo;s everything. <br /><br />Thank you to the amazing people who gave their time so generously to make this wish a reality, especially Coleen Campbell, who came up with the great makeup expressions&ndash;even when Jordan threw us the last minute audible to paint her face like a cheetah (didn&rsquo;t see that one coming). Jeffrey Paul, who rocked Jordan&rsquo;s hair. Johnny Franzen who gave us free reign over a terrific studio. And most of all, to Jennifer Pinto, who connected us with all the great artists and was positively unstoppable. Thanks also to all of you who cheered us on. All I can say is, &ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; You folks rock. <img alt="" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-1639181089156954290?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" width="1" /></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The photo session was fabulous! I am still a little shell-shocked by the generosity of the people who made it happen. A special shout-out to Jennifer Pinto at Exclusive Artists Management, makeup artist Coleen Campbell, stylist Jeffrey Paul, and studio manager Johnny Franzen. These folks are true professionals with giant hearts and inspiring talents.</p>
<p><br />I&rsquo;m not ready to post a set of photos yet because I&rsquo;m being a neurotic perfectionist. But, here&rsquo;s one work-in-progress that we&rsquo;re taking a liking to.<br /><br />More to come soon&hellip;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyvp9rFkFa1r5aaue.jpg" />Tomorrow, we hit the studio and do a really fun photo shoot. In preparation for that production, which we&rsquo;ve labeled &lsquo;War Paint&rsquo;, a friend suggested that Jordan write out what she&rsquo;d like to say to her cancer. She dictated to her mother this afternoon. I&rsquo;ll let Jordan&rsquo;s thoughts speak for themselves:<br /><br />&ndash;I&rsquo;m gonna kick your butt<br /><br />&ndash;Let&rsquo;s wrestle <br /><br />&ndash;I&rsquo;m stronger than you</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>She&rsquo;s resting comfortably in ICU. Her blood pressure is steadily making its way back to normal and her right leg continues to strengthen. Given all the fear and anxiety we started the day with, we&rsquo;re feeling very good. Before she dosed off for a nap, she let me take this picture. She has been smiling a lot. She also keeps negotiating with her medical team, trying to convince them she should be allowed to wear her own pajamas and lobbying for a McFlurry from McDonald&rsquo;s.<br /><br />When she came up to ICU she traveled with a posse&ndash;at least seven nurses, orderlies and doctors. All of them were smitten. She told them about her birthday plans and her dog and her brother and her favorite shows on TV. You would never have guessed that she had just completed a five hour high-risk procedure. It was beautiful to watch. We&rsquo;ve spent enough time in hospitals to know better than to assume the coast is clear, but it sure feels nice to see her smiling. And I&rsquo;m breathing easier knowing that the surgical team was able to remove so much of the tumor. It will be a few days before we get the pathology report back, but from the preliminary scan it looks as if this tumor was different from the rest of her disease. We&rsquo;re not going to worry about that right now.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She&rsquo;s awake in recovery. We&rsquo;ve been chatting. First words out of her mouth: I want to change into my pajamas.<br /><br />She has to stay flat on her back for 8 hours. She&rsquo;s cooperating, but not pleased. Her blood pressure is low, so she may move to ICU before a regular room.<br /><br />So far, her right leg is unresponsive. She is able to move her left and wiggle the toes on her left foot. It&rsquo;s still early.<br /><br />I told her she is amazing. She said, groggily, &ldquo;why wouldn&rsquo;t I be?&rdquo;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We just met with the surgeon. Jordan still has about an hour to go. They are closing her up. The surgery appears to have been a success. He was able to remove the tumor. She appears to have some weakness on her right side. We won&rsquo;t know how permanent that is until later. We are relieved that she handled the surgery so well and that her excellent team was able to remove the beast!</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I look up to the monitor in the waiting room and find her number. #7471. Next to it, the number 132. One hundred thirty two minutes into surgery, and so much more to go. One of the surgical nurses called me on my cell phone shortly after the procedure began.<br /><br />&ndash;I just wanted you to know that we started about 10 minutes ago and everything is going great.<br /><br />She promised to call later with an update. The procedure could take five hours or more. It&rsquo;s a massive team working on her. Many introduced themselves to us while Jordan was in pre-op. Residents, fellows, surgeons, anesthesiologists, and so many of the brand of kind, caring nurses we&rsquo;ve grown fond of at CHLA. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s possible to be comfortable during this process, but Jeanette and I are definitely less manic because we have so much faith in the team.<br /><br />Jordan took most of it in stride. True to form, she waxed loquacious on arrival and peppered me with a battery of questions before the sunrise. She was most concerned about the pajama plan. She wanted to know just how soon she could get out of the hospital&rsquo;s standard issue. She hates them. We told her it might be a day or two, which did not go over well. She wants to get back into her flannels as soon as surgery is over. She even asked her neurosurgeon if she had permission to put them on when she gets to her room. He said he didn&rsquo;t think it would be a problem. That calmed her somewhat.<br /><br />She was extraordinarily brave in pre-op—more so than usual. You could palpate her courage just standing close to her bed. Perhaps I felt it more than usual because it was wrapped around a bundle of anxiety. She was nervous. She didn&rsquo;t talk about this, but you could tell. She gets very calm when she is most afraid. It doesn&rsquo;t help to talk to her, or stroke her hair, kiss her cheek or hold her hand. If anything, those subtle gestures just make her more anxious, even crabby. She likes to be left alone. She steels herself for what she has to do. I can only imagine what thoughts must run through her mind as the doctors talk about the procedure and so many strangers in scrubs stop by to ask questions and look her over. Whatever runs through her mind, it doesn&rsquo;t stop her. She retreats into her sphinxen trance and looks off at fixed point somewhere in the room.<br /><br />About an hour before it was time to go to the O.R., a nurse started a drip of strong antibiotics. It is standard procedure. Jordan tolerates most medicines, but she had a reaction to this one. A tide of pink washed over her skin from head to chest, accompanied by a ravenous itchiness. She dug her fingers into her scalp, scratching with such ferocity that she drew blood. It was the only moment where she was really agitated and unlike herself. Even though it&rsquo;s a very common reaction to the antibiotic, I think Jordan expelled nervous energy through her nails. Jeanette and I had to hold her arms down at one point, which only vexed her more. Benadryl settled her down, but not before Jordan told her neurosurgeon that she was in &ldquo;a storm of itchiness.&rdquo; I think even he was surprised by her poetic description. The three of us stood silent for a moment to drink in that wonderful description of how she felt inside.<br /><br />When it was time to send her off, I took a deep breath and tried to saddle my own inner tempest. I told Jordan earlier in the morning that I might cry a little when it was time for her to go up to the operating room. I didn&rsquo;t want her to be scared, I said. &ldquo;Since Mom and Dad are doing all the worrying for you, sometimes we cry a little.&rdquo; She said she understood. And, as predicted, when I leaned over and kissed her on the forehead I splashed her with a few tears. I told her how proud she made me and how much I loved her. And I told her I would see her very soon. All things considered, I held it together pretty well until the doors closed and my girl was out of sight. Then I let it out. Nettie and I ducked into a small counseling room and drained our emotions for five minutes. We held each other, cried, and found our breath again.<br /><br />When I stepped into the shower at 4:45am this morning I wondered about all the people who are in the operating room with Jordan right now. I imagined faces I&rsquo;d never seen before, rolling out of bed and brushing their teeth, having their coffee and preparing to start their day. At 8am they had a long surgery to begin. They undoubtedly shuffled through a morning routine the way we all do. Perhaps they spent a few moments with their own kids, a spouse, a friendly dog. With the warm water running over my face, I thought about the dozen or more strangers who were about to take custody of my daughter&rsquo;s life. I am grateful to every one of them. And as the timer assigned to patient #7471 flashes 171, my heart is with them.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-2968871387981306356?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Until I held her in my arms I hadn&rsquo;t been bewitched. She with the perfectly rounded head, the bowed lips, the eyes that lifted your dreams. I learned about humility that day. I became a daughter&rsquo;s dad. I had been blessed before. No feeling like welcoming a son, they say. And it was glorious. But with this angel in my arms I thought the lottery had enriched me twice.<br /><br />I get asked how I&rsquo;m doing a lot these days. In the flurry of day-to-day life I try to tuck away my fears as much as I can. The best medicine for me and my family is to create the semblance of ordinary. Even Jordan works toward this goal. But reality bludgeons me here and there: a call/fight with the insurance company so that we can book the operating room, a note from a friend to schedule dinner for the family when Jordan comes home from the hospital, a moment with Jordan as a seizure animates her body.<br /><br />She will check in at Children&rsquo;s Hospital on Thursday morning. The surgery is expected to last for at least four hours, but it can go longer. Jordan will spend several days thereafter on her back recovering. It&rsquo;s never lost on us that the team continues to refer to this surgery as a &ldquo;high risk procedure.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the part that jars us from ordinary life.<br /><br />I honestly don&rsquo;t know how we are really doing. We put on a very good front. We work hard to make our life together as &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; as we can. The kids fight. The parents scold. We tease one another and find ways to horseplay. Bills get paid. Kids do their chores. And we behave like every family should behave. It&rsquo;s as if we refuse to let the disease change us. But it changes us every day and leaves a residue on everything we do.<br /><br />Jordan swam today. Our friends invited her over to their beautiful new home in the hills. Jordan was delighted to oblige. Last night I advised her to take it easy. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to do too much,&rdquo; I said.<br /><br />&ndash;Dad, it&rsquo;s going to be ok. I&rsquo;m just going to play in the water.<br /><br />I smiled and said nothing. Jordan kept going.<br /><br />&ndash;I&rsquo;m just going to have a good time, Dad.<br /><br />&ndash;I know Jordan. I just want you to take it easy.<br /><br />&ndash;I&rsquo;m just going to swim in the pool for a little bit.<br /><br />I smiled again.<br /><br />&ndash;Just let me have some fun, Dad. I just want to swim a little bit. I&rsquo;m just going to swim in the pool.<br /><br />She does this a lot. She repeats her argument. She goes on and on. I try to be patient, but at some point I feel the need to tap the needle so the record stops skipping.<br /><br />&ndash;I get it Jordan. Just do your dad a favor, ok.<br /><br />&ndash;I WILL, Dad.<br /><br />I stare across at her and I see those same gorgeous eyes that first transfixed me&ndash;wide pools of blue encircling a decisive punctuation mark of a pupil. You can&rsquo;t help but fall into this well. And lately I fall hard. When I make eye contact with her I feel ridiculously inept. This iron-willed, emphatic force of nature trusts me, just as she did that day she first breathed air, resting in my arms. Her eyes belie her fierceness. They reveal all the love she is capable of giving, the vulnerabilities she rarely admits, and the absolute trust she places in those who are closest to her. In some ways Jordan is a slayer because she doesn&rsquo;t worry about what we&rsquo;ve signed her up to do. If her parents tell her she has to do something to fight cancer, she&rsquo;ll do it. No questions asked. That may seem wonderfully remarkable, but to me it is absolutely terrifying. I have signed her up for another battle. I lose sleep over this decision knowing that she will go through with it more bravely than I ever could.<br /><br />Tonight she fell asleep on the sofa listening to Ella Fitzgerald with me. At one point, I spent a few minutes just admiring her, draped in one of her favorite blankets with her arm resting above her head. I tried to memorize her unmistakable profile&ndash;the same cherub lips I first admired on her very first day, braced beneath a delicate nose on a face that&rsquo;s no longer a baby&rsquo;s. I kissed her on the forehead, whispered how much I loved her, and wished that I would make all the right decisions in the days ahead. I wished that I could be a buffer and absorb the coming shocks, that I could be a comfort, that I could honor her trust and continue to be the one who protected her, that I could be the one who always made her laugh. I sat there with her for awhile more, wishing she would tell me not to worry again and again and again, like she does. She relies on me to be strong and I find strength in her.<br /><br />When it was time for me to go to bed, I stroked her hand and told her I was about to pick her up and carry her upstairs to her room where she&rsquo;d be more comfortable. Usually, she just nods and sleeps while I lift her. Tonight, she opened her eyes and shook her head no.<br /><br />&ndash;It&rsquo;s late. You need to sleep.<br /><br />&ndash;I need to brush my teeth first.<br /><br />I said ok, of course. But her brother was in the shower and she couldn&rsquo;t get to the toothbrush. She got very worried.<br /><br />&ndash;Do you think it will be alright if I don&rsquo;t brush my teeth before bed.<br /><br />Here she was, days before spinal surgery, worn out from a day of seizures and fatigued by the pace of slaying cancer&ndash;and she&rsquo;s worried about missing a night of teeth-brushing. I told her she could brush extra well in the morning. She said okay and let me tuck her into bed. As I was leaving her room she said, &ldquo;love you madly, Daddy.&rdquo; And I said what I always do.<br /><br />&ndash;Right back at you.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-7227245246919379124?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Surgery has been scheduled for Thursday, August 4th. She&rsquo;s booked to stay in the hospital for five days, unless her recovery goes really well and she&rsquo;s able to go home earlier. Many of you have asked how you can help. Thank you. We&rsquo;re putting a game plan together. It is likely that we&rsquo;ll need the most help once she&rsquo;s home. In the meantime, please keep Jordan in your thoughts. This is a high-risk surgical procedure. We&rsquo;re hopeful that Jordan will pull through it the way she usually does—astonishing her doctors at how well she recovers.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-3639630684193283579?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Without Many Words</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There’s a way she looks at me sometimes that puts me so at ease even though I’m a bundle of nerves. I could say that it is a wisdom beyond her years, but I know that it is actually her own nerves battling her resolve. When she is truly troubled about something–something that requires her to quiet herself and wander through her thoughts–her eyes take on the most lovely stillness. They are absolutely alive, but her gaze turns gentle and the corners of her mouth relax. It is not the facial expression you expect. We’ve seen her worry about surface issues. Her brows furrow. She crinkles her nose. Her eyes grow wide. But whenever she considers anything with gravity, it is the face I saw before me last night.

The slayer is in the fight again. The tumor in her spine has grown and it is seriously threatening healthy tissue within her spinal cord. This explains many of the recent health issues she’s experienced. We suspected something was afoot, but we learned officially yesterday when we met with the oncology team at CHLA. As we have already fought this tumor with chemotherapy and with radiation, Jordan’s medical team has suggested surgery within the next few weeks. Her situation cannot be ignored, and it cannot wait. We need to remove or stop the tumor before Jordan’s condition further deteriorates. The risk is high. If there are complications, she could be paralyzed from the waist down. But if we don’t do surgery, she most certainly will face the same outcome, and if the tumor spreads up her spinal cord, it could become life-threatening.

Jordan took the news hard at first. When she learned that the tumor was growing again, her first concern was that she’d have to restart chemotherapy. She told me, “I don’t want to get poked every day again. And I don’t want the medicine that makes my tummy hurt so bad.” Fortunately, chemo isn’t in the mix right now. After surgery the tissue will be biopsied to determine the tumor type. At that point, the oncology team will decide whether or not it is necessary for Jordan to recommence chemotherapy. Once she got over concerns about chemo, she expressed worry about having surgery. She remembers the pain of her leg surgery last year.

We had just left CHLA. Jordan, Jeanette and I stopped at El Cholo for dinner. We thought it might cheer her some and we were famished from a full day at the hospital. We shared the news with Jordan just before the food arrived. That’s when I got the deep, pensive gaze that accompanied her questions and concerns. She was quiet for a moment or two. Then she looked up at me, and with a maturity I find hard to comprehend she said, “let me think about it for a day. Let me sleep on it, Dad.”

Sometimes her pat answers and inspiring resolutions concern me. She’ll offer statements that sound more like a motivational quote than a true understanding of the situation. But today I knew she knew. I knew that she had been worried about this day for as long as we have. She’s felt her body betray her. All the symptoms we were told to watch for a year ago have come to fruition. She has back pain. She gets very fatigued. She has less balance on her feet. She has suffered embarrassing bouts of incontinence. With each passing day, her body reminds her something isn’t right, which might be why she was not nearly surprised by the news as I thought she might be.

I suppose it would be easier if this were the only challenge we were facing, but we still have the matter of the seizures. They come 2-3 times a day now and they have grown more powerful. In the past, the seizures mostly affected her ability to speak or understand what was going on around her. Now, they are taking over her motor function. When her legs first started shaking uncontrollably, we thought maybe she had restless leg. But the shaking has gotten worse and within minutes of an onset she loses control of her arms. Her entire body jerks as though a puppet master were toying with her. The hardest part for us is that lately Jordan has not blacked out. She’s aware of what her body is doing and it terrifies her. Last Sunday, I was standing in the doorway of her room when the seizure started. When her arms started jerking, she looked over at me very concerned and said, “this is so scary, Dad.” When the arm and leg spasms stop, Jordan gets very cold and her teeth chatter. On that day, she just cuddled with me, letting me warm her with my arms while she got quiet and eventually settled down for a nap.

The medical team does not believe the tumor is causing the increase in seizures. Instead, they believe something is happening in her brain. While her MRI doesn’t show much new tumor activity in her brain, the PET scan revealed a significant amount of calcification. We don’t know if her seizures are increasing because the tumor is continuing its slow progression, or because her brain is trying to cope with cancer’s aftermath. There is no prognosis, and no immediate treatment plan. This, perhaps more than anything else, is the most devastating part of Jordan’s latest step. She’s afraid to go out. She worries about even the slightest tickle in her stomach. She’s losing confidence. Sometimes, I think she gets blue. And the seizures always take so much out of her. She sleeps a lot and she has lost weight.

As if on cue, minutes after we talked to Jordan in the restaurant about her situation, her leg began shaking. Jeanette gave her some medicine and we talked to her quietly to see how she was doing. Jordan said, “let’s go home. Let’s take the food to go.” We had just sat down and hadn’t placed our orders. Jordan fidgeted in her chair and wrung her hands.

–Jordan, is your leg still shaking? Are you feeling any better?

I searched her eyes for clues. She was anxious, but she told me that her leg wasn’t shaking any more. I put my hand on her thigh and could barely feel the spasm. It appeared it was only a small seizure and maybe the medicine was helping. But when the waiter came to take our order, Jordan’s arms began shaking. I reached under the table and felt the spasms in her legs. She kept twisting her head awkwardly to look up at me. She could speak, but her eyes were preoccupied. The waiter paused from the order and watched with concern. I meant to say something, to explain what was happening, but I was focused on Jordan. I held her and kissed her forehead as her body began to relax. She was quiet for a couple of minutes and then said, “Can we have some flan?” Just like that, she was back.

Truthfully, Jeanette and I don’t know what we should be doing and we’re not feeling that we’re as strong as we can be for Jordan. There’s just so much uncertainty, so much to process. We’ve stayed pretty quiet about her recent change in health, opting to wait for more information from the medical team. As you might imagine, we often linger in dark thoughts. We don’t know if this is the beginning of a progressive process. We don’t know if the disease is switching gears. We don’t know if the tumor grew to its current size in 3 months or 3 weeks. We don’t have reason to believe that Jordan’s life is in danger, but things are changing so quickly and we’ve been watching her fade day by day. Sometimes, all we can do is close the door to our bedroom and cry together. We want to be very strong for Jordan and for Luc. Our family is so important to us. It’s important to Jordan, too.

We don’t know yet when the surgery will be scheduled. When it’s done, she’ll be in the hospital for about a week. It will take several weeks for her to fully recover. As much as I dread the process she must experience, I have every reason to believe that Jordan will approach it as she always has–with stoicism, bravery and a take-no-prisoners attitude. I rarely appeal to my friends on this journey, but this time around I will need their help. After eight years, we’re all showing signs of wear and tear. We have been blessed with a terrific circle of kind souls, some right in the neighborhood, some halfway around the world. I may not be able to post as frequently, and my posts might was a bit more dark than usual. I thank you all in advance for your kindness and your support for my family during the rough days ahead.]]></content:encoded>

<p>She had three seizures today. She maintained consciousness through them all, but her body spasmed so severely that her shoulders jerked forward and her legs kicked. Her eyes dilated wide for an instant, then shrunk as she observed it all. She told us she was scared as she watched her body behave on its own. We held her; placed our hands on the jerking limbs to try and comfort them towards sedation.<br /><br />True to form, after each seizure Jordan was ready to do her next thing. We had to lobby her to lie still and rest. Twice she ignored us.<br /><br />Her body is revolting and she has been kidnapped. Each incursion exacts a toll. She has less energy. She is afraid to go out. She gets justifiably cranky.<br /><br />Still, she presses on. At the end of a long day that left her feeling less than herself she insisted on doing her homework. I watched her and could only think to grab my camera. It is moments like these that give me strength, hope, and inspiration. She never accepts a setback. Never.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jordan is back at CHLA today for her quarterly MRI scans. As I write this, she&rsquo;s enjoying a great nap thanks to her usual propofol cocktail. She&rsquo;s had some rough times over the past few weeks. While there&rsquo;s no evidence of new tumor activity, the many tumors of the past have wreaked havoc on her system. She has seizures almost every day. They rarely last for more than a few minutes, but the larger ones sap her energy and make her want to nap. Sometimes her body just doesn&rsquo;t seem very cooperative. A leg will shake uncontrollably, or she&rsquo;ll get the shivers in 80 degree heat, or she&rsquo;ll completely lose her balance. It&rsquo;s beginning to tax her confidence, and that&rsquo;s hard to watch for us all. But she plows ahead like always.<br /><br />We&rsquo;ll post more when we have new news.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-492409757148684767?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyvo1yn1Le1r5aaue.jpg" /><br /><br />We haven&rsquo;t received the report from Jordan&rsquo;s PET scan on Wednesday, but we&rsquo;re also not expecting anything surprising. After a day&rsquo;s rest, Jordan was back to school. She had a very busy weekend. Friday night, she performed in her class play about American History. She remembered her lines and sang with gusto. On Saturday, she carried on with my good friend Mary Ann Mooney as if they had known each other for decades. And then, on Father&rsquo;s Day, she made me feel extra special while we relaxed in the Backyard of the W Hotel. Jordan got her nails done, ate a giant plate of salmon, and dipped in the pool &hellip; because that&rsquo;s how she rolls. Oh, while in the pool, she mixed it up with a party of tatooed adults. As we left, they said, &ldquo;bye, Jordan. Have a great day!&rdquo;<br /><br /><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyvo3cWKWm1r5aaue.jpg" /></p>
<p>Before the weekend officially started, Jordan appeared in her class play. She was marvelous.<br /><br /><a href="http://jordanvincent.laurencevincent.com/files/2011/06/LMV_2531.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyvo4kJUj11r5aaue.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>While enjoying her swim, Jordan introduced herself to a party in progress. She won them over in five minutes flat.</p>

<p><em>A lead partition separated us from Jordan after the radionuclide tracer was injected.</em><br /><br /><em>Here are the rules, Jordan. After we give you this medicine, you can&rsquo;t talk. You have to lie still.</em><br /><br />Jordan squinted one eye as she often does when processing a request. This was new information. We didn&rsquo;t know that she&rsquo;d have to go for nearly an hour without talking or moving around. Jordan can tolerate pain that would make a Hell&rsquo;s Angel cry, but going silent for a long stretch of time is a real challenge.<br /><br />&ndash; Do you understand?<br /><br />Jordan looked over at me. Her face was lined with an expression I&rsquo;ve seen before. It&rsquo;s the face that says, &ldquo;Dad, can you help me out here?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ndash; I have an idea, I said. Let&rsquo;s play the quiet game. Can you beat me?<br /><br />Odd as it may sound, Jordan loves the quiet game. She frequently loses, for the reason stated above, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop her from trying. As anyone who&rsquo;s read her journey knows, she loves to compete.<br /><br />Jordan didn&rsquo;t answer me. Instead, she laid down and let the nurse inject the radioactive isotope into her bloodstream. Then, she remained silent and still for a full hour. In fact, she dosed off and enjoyed a nice nap for a bit. When I woke her up with a kiss and a friendly greeting, she lit up with a giant smile. She knew she&rsquo;d beaten me.<br /><br />We&rsquo;re at CHLA today for a PET scan. The doctors want to get better imaging of Jordan&rsquo;s brain and they&rsquo;re hoping for clues on why she&rsquo;s having so many seizures. Unlike the MRIs to which she has become accustomed, the PET scan uses nuclear medicine. The isotope goes into her blood stream and behaves much like glucose. The scanner maps where the brain takes up the most of the tracer. By identifying where the brain is most active, the team hopes to isolate areas where tumor or indolent tissue may be affecting Jordan&rsquo;s normal brain function.<br /><br />After the one hour wait was up, Jordan rose and made her way to the scanning tube. She was still a little groggy and I figured she wanted her mom to be with her as they administered the anesthesia, so I stayed back in the room. A few minutes later the lead door opened and the nurse told me Jordan was asking for me. I found her smiling again.<br /><br />&ndash; Dad, you know I always have to hold your hand when they give me the sleep medicine.<br /><br />I was only too glad to oblige. As her eyes rolled back and her face relaxed, I got a little misty. Even though she&rsquo;s comfortable and far from harm, it&rsquo;s always hard for me to watch her fade away. But I was smiling, too. I&rsquo;ve never known anyone who is as full of life as she. It isn&rsquo;t a radioactive isotope that makes her a superhero. She was like that before.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>One of many self-portraits Jordan sends me now and again.</em><br /><br />Every once in awhile, Jordan sends me text messages from her phone. As she cannot read, she often sends me words she comes across. I&rsquo;ve had texts that read simply, &ldquo;Oreos,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Barbie.&rdquo; Sometimes she just sends me her initials or she sends me the word &ldquo;love.&rdquo; I love them all. But my favorite texts are the pictures she sends via MMS. These are usually self portraits she snapped just then with her phone. Occasionally I get a photo from her library. Today, she sent me a picture of her at about the age of two. She&rsquo;s sitting at our old dining room table, enjoying a small cup of tea. The smile on her face says it all.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[To tell you the truth, we were absolute cowards. The boy and I stood in the middle of the 3rd Street Promenade finding ways to avoid our assignment. Our family was on a photographic field trip. Each of us had to approach a complete stranger and ask if we could take their portrait. We only had to get one, but the goal of the assignment was to capture as many as we could before the good natural light disappeared for the day. I kept shooting “test shots” of Luc to make sure my exposure was good. He kept shuffling his feet and fidgeting with his gear. Jeanette chased after Jordan, who walked right up to a family, introduced herself and attempted to get her first portrait of the evening.

– Can I take your picture?

– Oh. You want to take my picture?

– Yes. It’s for an as-, it’s for an as-, it’s…

Jeanette interrupted her quietly.

– Try again, Jordan.

– It’s for an assignment.

<!--more-->

The woman looked surprised and I don’t think she knew what to say. Jeanette explained that Jordan wanted to take a portrait of her because we were working on a photography project. The woman said she felt a little uncomfortable having her picture taken and apologized. Jordan just smiled and looked fo her next victim. Meanwhile, the boy and I continued our shuffling as a stream of interesting subjects passed us by. Awhile later, Jordan got a portrait. And she was very proud.

I suppose that after eight years of cancer slaying, the fear of rejection is a pale threat. I wouldn’t say that Jordan is fearless, but there is no question that she is brave. It’s not in her character to step away from a challenge, but there’s more to the story than her steely determination. I’m convinced that Jordan does not see the world the way the rest of us do. In her long war with cancer, it isn’t just situational conditioning that has made her so forward socially. I think the disease has affected her biologically. She will be 13 in just a couple of months, but we often feel she is mentally younger and more childlike with each passing day … and it scares me. She truly has a hard time relating to people and she struggles to make friends. It doesn’t seem to bother her much. Jordan lives in a bubble. You’re in her perimeter of cognition or you’re not, and the perimeter isn’t very large. I watch her peers interact with her. They are cautious. Distant. And, as is natural for adolescents, quick to label her different.

It wasn’t always this way. When Jordan was four years old she was reading! She was precociously bright and a good student at her preschool. Nothing got by her. She was sharp as a tack. She was also a binder between her friends. If some of the girls were fighting, Jordan usually stepped in and smoothed things over.

Today, Jordan can’t do a lot of those things. Like the interaction with the portrait subject, her brain gets stuck sometimes. Choosing words can be difficult. And she has a very short attention span. We don’t know if it is because of the tumors or the various rounds of chemotherapy, but over time that acuity and social knowledge has definitely faded. It’s subtle. I often don’t realize how much she’s softened around the edges until we’re in a situation with children her age. Her behavior is then so noticeably different from others. And she has no filter.

Within minutes of meeting a new acquaintance she will reveal intimate insights about her hospital stays and various treatments, or she’ll share embarrassing stories about her brother (which he does not appreciate). She still has charm, and she speaks with such genuine innocence that most people fall in love with her. Yet I worry about her future and I still grieve the many intellectual losses. I wish she could read again. I wish she had a best friend. I wish she could relate to others without making cancer the centerpiece of conversation. I never want her to feel defined by her illness. She is so much more.

Despite the taxes the disease and therapy have levied against her mind, she can still be resillently witty. Some of her observations floor us. And it’s delightful to watch her charge forward into parties and gatherings. While she may have a hard time relating to others, she can win over a room in an instant with bravery and flare. She pulls off celebrity well. She likes to be the center of attention, and she has no trouble attracting a spotlight.

From what we can tell, the disease is dormant again. The tumor in her spine is shrinking and there isn’t any evidence of activity in the dark cloud of tumor tissue loitering in her head. She’s enjoying a break from chemotherapy, and radiation is through. But the ghost lingers and haunts us with seizures here and there, providing us with a foreboding reminder that this journey continues. A few days before our street photography field trip, Jordan had a seizure that lasted more than five minutes. Her school dialed 9-1-1 and she ended up in the hospital for the rest of the day. She recovered quickly and was released later that night. When I arrived, she was alert and she wasted no time regaling all her complaints about being in the ER. I didn’t mind. I still remember days when the seizures that put her in the hospital knocked her out and set her in a week-long coma. I’d rather listen to the verbal ranting than have to go through that ever again.

When Jordan returned to school the next day, one of her friends welcomed her back and told her that another student with special needs had just had a seizure. Jordan flared up and started screaming.

– I don’t want to hear that word right now!

Jeanette intervened and insisted on an attitude adjustment. Jordan apologized to her friend and tried to explain that she was still shaken by her hospital experience. Her friend apologized for bringing it up and they went on their way together. Perhaps I should worry less about her social life and celebrate the fire and fancy of my abiding hero. I might do well to follow her example and resist the temptation to let fear stop me. Now, if I can just take a great street portrait…]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s been a long week. I don’t even know where to start. Jordan is still at CHLA and doing pretty well. When I have more time, I want to share some great highlights from the week. There’s so much to share – like how she met a friend on the floor who has the same birthday, and they got along so well that they decided to share a room. Or, how she calls me at least once every day just to see how my day is going. Or, how she impresses the nurses when she presses on with physical therapy even after she’s had a nasty seizure.  As you might expect, she continues to be slayer-strong, and she wins everyone over with her sassy but delightful attitude. Her legs really are getting stronger, but she’s still 3-5 weeks away from coming home.

What I really want to share today is, well, today. On day #24 she was granted a “day pass.” That means she was allowed (actually, strongly encouraged!) to leave the hospital with her family for 12 hours. It was the first time she set foot outside since surgery. We dolled her up and took her to see Harry Potter. Our whole family loves these movies and we weren’t able to go when it first came out because of the surgery. Jordan loved it! We all did. And afterward we had lunch at The Grove with our friend Catherine Davie. Jordan just beamed and we all had a great time together. I think she had so much fun that she didn’t mind so much when the afternoon was ended and it was time to go back to her rigorous schedule of recovery. I could tell you more, but I’m exhausted and I’ll let the pictures speak for themselves. I even have a little video I caught with Jordan yesterday.

While we were shopping, Jordan found a hat that she loved and I was only to happy to buy it for her. Doesn’t she look like a summer princess?

Jordan enjoyed using her new camera. She took this photo of Luc and I during our lunch at The Farm

We would have taken more photos at The Grove, but frankly, we were having too much fun. When we got back to CHLA, Jordan and I decided to chase Luc with the wheelchair. Jordan took this photo of him running from our menacing dash.

Can you tell how tuckered out this girl in curly locks was at the end of her great day? She had so much fun.

<img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyub9wT8r81r5aaue.jpg" alt="" />

When she got back, dinner was waiting for her … and so was her Auntie Kelly. What a great way to finish the day.

My other girl, Jeanette, looks on as Jordan shares stories from her day pass day.

Luc liked playing with Jordan’s new camera. Before we left the hospital, he took this picture just for his sister. He said, “it’s a message for you, Jordan.” She thought this was cool.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While it&rsquo;s true that I like to write, I thought it would be better to tell you about Jordan&rsquo;s 13th birthday in pictures. I&rsquo;ll only write five words without a photo: she had a great day! Thank you to all who worked so hard to make the big teen transition a big event and a fabulous tea party. So many people to thank, but I want to call out a few. First, thank you to Melody Griffith for making the most delicious tea sandwiches. Thank you also to Genevieve Ostrander, our friend of so many years, for her fantastic cakes and baked goods, fresh from her wonderful Delilah Bakery. Thanks to my sister Lisa for coming up with the tea party idea and making so fabulous. And thank you to everyone who dropped in and made my cancer slayer feel like a million bucks. All of our friends rock!<br /><br />I also want to thank the amazing people at Alex&rsquo;s Lemonade Stand Foundation (ALSF) and The Daily Grill. Jordan&rsquo;s birthday fell on National Lemonade Day. The Daily Grill invited families associated with ALSF to their restaurant for a free lunch to celebrate the occasion. Of course, Jordan wasn&rsquo;t able to leave the hospital so the very nice folks at The Daily Grill brought lunch to her! Before the big party, she enjoyed a delicious meal of cedar plank salmon and chocolate cake. She thought the meal was even more delicious when she learned that many of her friends and family had made donations in her honor to ALSF. Thank you!!!<br /><br />She was very excited about her birthday</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyubfy9vpY1r5aaue.jpg" /></p>
<p><br />And she was very excited when it was time to start opening the presents. She loves presents.</p>
<p>First step, put that Mickey Mouse button on. Now, she&rsquo;s a happy birthday girl.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyubizcIP41r5aaue.jpg" /><br /><br />Look at the beautiful face laughing. Is there anything else a Dad could wish for than big smiles from his daughter?</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyubk9NLdw1r5aaue.jpg" /><br /><br />We had a very good turnout, with so many friends gathering around in the CHLA garden to celebrate big #13.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyubl2EdLI1r5aaue.jpg" /></p>
<p>What did Jordan choose to wear for her big birthday? A cute little backless purple dress, of course. She didn&rsquo;t pay the slightest mind to the fact that her freshest scar was on display. Who cares about a scar when you&rsquo;ve got celebrating to do?</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyubmgt9vr1r5aaue.jpg" /><br /><br />Jordan had plenty of stories to share with her guests. She was chatty from the moment the event began.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyubnbYlCo1r5aaue.jpg" /><br /><br />One of our dearest friends, the baker extraordinaire, Genevieve Ostrander, brought so many goodies for the party. If you haven&rsquo;t visited Delilah Bakery in Silverlake, you haven&rsquo;t really lived. No, really.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyubwqpv2C1r5aaue.jpg" /><br /><br />One scene-stealer: Aunt Lisa and Uncle Ricky gave Jordan a box filled with little Chanel introductions. Auntie Lisa explained that 13 was the proper age to have Chanel in a girl&rsquo;s life.  Jordan was only too glad to follow the advice.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyubxstEvS1r5aaue.jpg" /><br /><br />Jordan had plenty of time to chat with girlfriends. She loves this!</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyubz07FNS1r5aaue.jpg" /><br /><br />Whoa! What&rsquo;s this? My friend Cathy Sincere Biermann at Disney put together a little gift box &ndash; and I&rsquo;m being liberal with my use of the word &lsquo;little.&rsquo;</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyuc06LA5v1r5aaue.jpg" /><br /><br />Jordan got up and decided to move over for this box of goodness. Weak legs be damned! She got up so fast Jeanette had to jump up and help. Nothing will keep this girl away from a big box of goodies.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyuc2hu8t41r5aaue.jpg" /></p>
<p><br />This box was chalk full of exactly the stuff Jordan loves &ndash; novelties and fashions inspired by her idol, Selena Gomez.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyucnb7OYI1r5aaue.jpg" /><br /><br />And as the Selena Gomez loot begins to come out, look at the smile on her face!</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyucozdKwz1r5aaue.jpg" /></p>
<p>Seriously, just a few weeks ago she was asking a sales woman to help her find outfits like Selena Gomez wears. Now she has some.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyuco8NpP51r5aaue.jpg" /></p>
<p>And who doesn&rsquo;t want a Selena Gomez backpack? She was in heaven! Just in time for school, too. Thanks, Cathy and thanks, Disney.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyucr0sFpB1r5aaue.jpg" /><br /><br />Just as we were in birthday present heaven it was time for cake. Genevieve and the folks at Delilah outdid themselves on this beauty.</p>
<p><br /><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyucsfsOvz1r5aaue.jpg" /></p>
<p>First, everyone sang &ldquo;Happy Birthday&rdquo;. I also shared the Tweet from Jordan&rsquo;s friend Mal all the way down in Australia. She laughed when I said tha he wished her a &ldquo;hippy happy Birthday.&rdquo;<br /><br />Then, it was time to blow out the candles. It&rsquo;s hard to blow out 13 candles!</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyuctg42yf1r5aaue.jpg" /><br /><br />Look at that cake! It was delicious.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyucvfF1bp1r5aaue.jpg" /><br /><br />After the fabulous party, we went back up to Jordan&rsquo;s room and sorted out all the gifts. Jordan was tired but so excited about the day.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyucwqZoMZ1r5aaue.jpg" /><br /><br />We transferred all the decorations, flowers and birthday accoutrement up to her room. And, Jordan decided to keep going. She was delighted when she convinced her aunt and uncle to spend the night with her and extend the celebration.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyucxq0JPc1r5aaue.jpg" /></p>
<p>Poor Ricky. He was stuck with these two. When Jordan and Lisa are together, it&rsquo;s a total girl-fest.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyucyl7NDF1r5aaue.jpg" /><br /><br />But Jordan took a break to do what teenagers do best &ndash; talk on the phone! She connected with our friends Matthias and Lisa to tell them all about her big milestone.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyucz3Fitn1r5aaue.jpg" /><br /><br />Here&rsquo;s a picture that made Jordan pretty happy. Mom and Dad told her that our present was to help her redecorate her room to make the &ldquo;fashion design&rdquo; room she&rsquo;s been hoping for. First step: we hung the curtains that she made herself. They&rsquo;ll be waiting for her when she comes home. She said, &ldquo;oh, thank you, Daddy. That&rsquo;s so nice!&rdquo;</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She has been waiting for this day all year. To be technically accurate, she has been waiting for it for a couple years, telling people who asked her how old she was that she would soon be a teenager when she was just eleven. Jordan relates teen status as a magical transformation. In her mind, she joins an elite club today and she&rsquo;s pretty excited about it.<br /><br />I will post updates from the festivities later, but right now I have a special request. It is not only Jordan&rsquo;s big, enormous, gigantic, stupendous birthday celebration. It is also National Lemonade Day. And if you text &ldquo;Lemonade Day&rdquo; to 85944 on your mobile phone you can donate $10 to <a href="http://www.alexslemonade.org/" target="_blank">Alex&rsquo;s Lemonade Foundation</a>, which raises money for pediatric cancer research. Think of it this way, my girl&rsquo;s a cancer slayer and this wonderful organization is like the &ldquo;watcher&rsquo;s council.&rdquo; (A deep, Buffy the Vampire Slayer cut for you sci-fi fans). ALF does fantastic work. It raises money to end childhood cancer, but it also provides loving support to children and their families. If you really want to get your groove on for Jordan&rsquo;s birthday today, pour yourself a glass of lemonade and give a gift to ALF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When we arrived the room was empty; just a bed with fresh sheets watching over a lonely window. All of Jordan and Jeanette’s things were there, just not the girls. Before my mom and I could worry a nurse peeked in and told us that Jordan was taking a shower. Our shoulders relaxed and we each found a seat to wait.<!--more-->

I wasn’t sure what to expect today. Yesterday, she was so somber. She sat quietly and didn’t feel much like chatting. She let me read to her, but then she rolled over and closed her eyes in a half-state of nappiness. We’re convinced the test was to blame for her subdued mood. The neurology team wired her chest and the top of her head with electrodes for an extended EEG and video surveillance. They’re trying to understand what’s happening in her brain when her legs and arm shake uncontrollably. The whole team has assumed these spasms were a form of seizure, but Jordan is on so many anti-seizure medicines at the moment that it has everyone puzzled that she continues to have these issues. The latest hypothesis is that they may not be seizures at all. But the team needs more data to decide one way or the other. Hence the Frankenstein bundle of colored wires that erupted from Jordan’s head, wrapped in a bandage she found distastefully drab.

When they first wired her, Jeanette said she was bubbly and cooperative. She was intrigued. Then, the technician told her that she’d have to keep it all on for 24 hours. That was less intriguing to her. In fact, she looked over at her mom and asked incredulously “really?” She weathered through, but in 24 hours she only had three brief spasms. Brief spasms. So brief that there was still insufficient data. So, the team decided to extend the study for another 48 hours. Jordan was livid. By the time I saw her on Saturday morning I think she had resigned herself to her unfashionable fate. She lay there in her bed like a dog or cat who is forced to wear one of those cones to protect themselves after a procedure, looking forlorn and utterly miserable. That’s how I last saw my girl.

Just as I was thinking about this she wheeled into the room with her mother. All of the bandages, electrodes and sorrows had disappeared. She was fresh out of the shower, her hair still wet and her skin looking fresh. She wore a giant smile and shimmied a little in the wheelchair when she saw me. I told her she looked great and gave her a big hug. She wanted to get into the dress she’d had me bring from home. As soon as she’d changed, she visited with my mom and I. It was a completely different girl. I love it when she’s like this. It’s easy to have hope when she has this much spirit.

We’re stuck in a tedious state of ignorance. We don’t know what’s causing the spasms, and we probably won’t have much more insight until the team returns for work on Monday. We don’t know how long Jordan will stay at CHLA for physical therapy, and we probably won’t know until they consult with us on Tuesday. One nurse told us that it could be as long as four weeks. And, we don’t have all the details on the pathology of the biopsies. We know the tumor that was removed was different from previous biopsies. We also know that some of the tissue they biopsied was indeed dead tumor. Short of that, we don’t know much, but again, we hope to learn more in the days ahead.

We also know that Jordan is losing weight. It’s a common side effect of some of the medicines she’s taking. That doesn’t make us feel much better though. She’s quite thin. The CHLA team has ordered her to drink as many milk shakes and smoothies as she’d like. They’re encouraging her to consume calories. This makes her happy.

<img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyud5eWEKf1r5aaue.jpg" alt="" />

<small>Jordan takes one day at a time, and keeps her spirits up with fashion and conversation.</small>

Rehab is going slow so far. The seizure/spasm episodes have interrupted some sessions. Then the test delayed others. Jordan’s legs are getting stronger, but she still can’t walk on her own. She needs a walker and someone to guide her. Her bladder isn’t completely under her own control, which makes her angry and often ashamed. We try to remind her whenever we can that this is a common side effect of the surgery, and that it will probably subside as she gets stronger.

Her birthday is our biggest challenge at the moment. It’s next Saturday. She has been pretty excited about the fact that she’s about to officially become a teenager. You can imagine how excited she is about achieving that milestone in the hospital. Until a few days ago, we’d hoped she’d be out of the hospital before her birthday, but that seems a bleak probability at this point. So, Jeanette and I have been preparing her. Today, I told her that it was very likely that she’d have to celebrate at CHLA, but we would make it the biggest blow out ever, I declared. I reminded her of the old adage that when life gives you lemons, you make lemonade (a friend of my mom’s made her a quilt on this theme). Jordan nodded a bit reluctantly. Now, I’ve got to deliver on that promise. I’m open to suggestions from friends. Somehow, we will make #13 memorable – in a good way. I’m determined.

<p><em>Jordan enjoys a teen mag sent by our friends at Siegel+Gale</em><br /><br />I suspect that Superman feels this way after he&rsquo;s expunged the kryptonite only to find Lex Luther has hatched another diabolical plan. In his head, he must think, &ldquo;good grief!&rdquo; Perhaps every superhero has a Charlie Brown alter ego. That&rsquo;s how Jordan must feel. It&rsquo;s not enough to slay cancer. You have to relearn how to use your legs. And you can&rsquo;t go home!<br /><br /> <br /><br />She&rsquo;s super human. In every way. In five days she&rsquo;s proven that she can take a superhuman punch and get right back up on her feet &hellip; almost. We&rsquo;re grateful the legs are working, but they&rsquo;ve got a ways to go before she can chasse around the house and keep us on our toes. Make no mistake, she&rsquo;s on them as often as she can. The only complaint you hear when it&rsquo;s time for physical therapy is how much she&rsquo;s sweating.<br /><br />This is why I am intoxicated with this girl.<br /><br />Yet, make no mistake, she gets blue.<br /><br />It&rsquo;s the pace that troubles her. She wants to be home. She wants to be on her feet. She wants it all to be over. Who can blame her? I think that&rsquo;s the curse of being superhuman. Everyone admires you and everyone applauds your derring-does. But you just want to do like the rest of the world. I suspect that sometimes superheroes like Jordan want to be perfectly ordinary. They mumble to themselves, &ldquo;yeah, yeah, yeah &hellip; give me a pair of pajamas and the remote to the television.&rdquo; Of course, they can&rsquo;t have it. There&rsquo;s another challenge to face. Sisyphus has it easy, they think. Give him my boulder and then cry me a river.<br /><br />We read together tonight. I did my best acting job and she sat quietly, listening &hellip; tapping her fingers across the side of the hospital bed, smiling at me when I looked up from the page. Every so often I&rsquo;d ask if she was alright and she&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; Then I&rsquo;d read some more.<br /><br />Nurses came in occasionally to check on this or that. One said, &ldquo;I want to pull up a chair.&rdquo; Jordan smiled and said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s my Daddy.&rdquo; I felt superhuman, and yet totally helpless. I suspect that&rsquo;s how she feels times ten. But it doesn&rsquo;t stop her.<br /><br />Tomorrow she begins in-patient physical therapy. She&rsquo;ll put her body to the test on an aggressive regimen geared towards making her legs obey her will. That&rsquo;s a tall order, but she&rsquo;s given it before. No one doubts what she'lll accomplish. Not her doctors or her parents or even her. Still, that&rsquo;s small consolation for a girl who wants to do what all the other girls do. It must be lonely. As much as I&rsquo;m grateful she&rsquo;s superhuman, my greatest wish is that she can be super as an ordinary human.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>QUICK UPDATE: We thought Jordan might come home today. Unfortunately, she still has a ways to go on her mobility. Her team doesn&rsquo;t think she would be safe back at home just yet. When I got the news this morning, Jordan was in a stairwell with physical therapists practicing climbs. She&rsquo;s motivated and working hard, but not ready to bid the hospital farewell. Tomorrow, she&rsquo;ll be evaluated and her doctors will decide whether or not she needs to spend more time at CHLA for in-patient physical therapy. Even though the slayer doesn&rsquo;t care much for this option, her mom and I are supportive. When Jordan lost the use of her legs five years ago because of a severe reaction to a chemotherapy drug, the intense regimen of in-patient physical therapy helped her ditch the wheelchair. I&rsquo;ll post soon, when I have more news. <br /><br />Thanks again to everyone who has followed along, sent words of encouragement, and kept us in your thoughts. It means a lot to Jordan and it means a lot to her family. You folks rock!</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4><strong>The Journey in Photographs:
<em>Images from the first 48 hours</em></strong></h4>

<hr />

Strictly speaking, I don’t believe in magic. Oh, I like to watch a good sleight of hand, and I’ve been known to label scientific progress as “magical” a time or two, but I’m one of those guys who believes every unexplained phenomenon can be logically explained somehow. I can’t explain Jordan’s progress. It is everything we could have hoped for and more. To watch her these past two days is to experience pure, bewitching magic.

The surgery was a great success. We’ve always thought of her neurosurgeon as a rock star, but his latest performance is hall-of-fame worthy. Jordan had an MRI of her spine yesterday morning, and from the looks of it it appears he was able to remove all of the tumor in her spine. That, in itself, is terrific news, but what makes it all the more gratifying is that Jordan is recovering so quickly. She has no pain. In fact, since her surgery she’s only had one dose of Tylenol to address some soreness in her shoulders. Tylenol! She is in great spirits–super talkative, ebullient, and occasionally ornery. She is able to sit up and move around freely. All of her vital signs are good. She is able to move both legs. Her right leg is still weaker than her left, but she can lift it, bend it, and wiggle her toes some. And, she is starting to walk.

At about 5pm on Friday, Jordan met Laura, her physical therapist. Laura is a perfect fit for Jordan. She shares Jordan’s unbridled drive and mixes it with great fun. She reminded me of the ideal athletic coach: always pushing, encouraging, and changing up the game plan from time to time to keep the player engaged. Jordan was instantly attached to her.

–Let’s get out of this bed and do some walking, Laura said

–Ok.

Jordan sat up, a broad smile across her face. She was ready to throw her legs over and move. We actually had to slow her down and remind her that there were some preparations we had to make first. After Laura fetched a walker and prepared Jordan’s IV and catheter bag for mobility, it was time for Jordan to stand up on her own two feet. I watched her face as she slowly dragged her right leg over the side of the bed and began to put her weight forward. I think this was the first time that Jordan realized her legs felt different. She looked concerned as her right foot curled under and barely  moved the way she thought it would. But she didn’t give up. You could see the effort in her face. While Laura encouraged her to keep at it, Jordan willed her foot to move forward. It did so gradually, and eventually she was standing on it; her arms shaking to support her weight. The left foot moved a little easier, but still jerky and awkward.

Laura and Jordan practiced making small steps around her room. Jordan kept trying to do too much too fast. In her head, she knows what she wants her legs to do, but they can’t do it yet. We kept reminding her to only move one foot at a time. She wants to be fluid, but when she tries to move one foot before the other has completed its step she loses her balance. The walker begins to get away from her and she careens to the side.

It was an amazingly emotional experience. I was completely inspired by what she was doing at that moment. She was learning to walk again and it was anything but easy. She was incredibly focused and she was working up a sweat. At one point, she exclaimed, “this is a lot of work!” But she didn’t give up. In fact, after the first few minutes I imagined that Laura would say this was all for the day. And this is why Laura is such a good fit for Jordan. After those first tough, clumsy steps, Laura said, “great! Let’s put on your leg splints and walk down the hall.” Jordan was all in.

After she’d put on her splints and shoes, Jeanette stood behind Jordan and held her waist for support. Laura held the IV. I tried to stay out of the way and open doors as needed. I also grabbed my camera. Jordan began a slow, 10 minute walk out of her room, down the hallway and back. To help her focus on one foot at a time, we coached her with a rhythmic script.

–Right foot. Left foot. Walker. Right foot. Left foot. Walker.

It took the longest for her to move the right foot each time. And as the time passed, she had less and less strength to lift it all the way from the floor. She jutted forward with the walker, groaning here and there, willing her feet to carry her. Jeanette received quite a work out, supporting Jordan and catching her when her steps threatened to get away from her. However, she successfully made her way down the hall and back. And when it was done, she sat down in a chair, completely exhausted. I was swept away by the glory of it. 24 hours before I had worried so much that Jordan might not walk again. I never would have imagined that she would be on her feet so soon after such a challenging surgery. I had shortchanged my girl’s spirit. I must never forget that she’s a warrior–a tough-as-nails competitor. That’s why cancer keeps getting kicked in the teeth. I am so proud of her and so delighted that she is back to herself.

We still have some challenges ahead. We know that the tumor that was removed is different from the tumor tissue she was originally diagnosed with. From the analysis the team conducted in the operating room, it appears to be an astrocytoma. We don’t know anything more about the grade or type just yet. That analysis should come through this week. There is a good chance the oncology team will recommend more chemo. Jordan has had a few seizures in the hospital. These trouble her. And she’s a little worried because her bladder function isn’t 100% yet. We’re hoping she will regain enough strength that she doesn’t need to be catheterized. At the moment, she’s not able to expel enough urine to keep herself safe. She could have kidney failure if she can’t improve this function. We knew this was a possibility because of the surgery, but we’re hopeful that Jordan will keep getting stronger.

Just a moment ago she called me on my cell phone.

–Dad, I have some good news for you!

–What?

–The doctor just game in and he took off my band-aid.

–Which band-aid?

–The one that was on my back! Isn’t that great?

It was no band-aid at all. It was the surgical dressing. Jordan was thrilled to have it off and I was amazed that she’s healing so fast. I guess maybe magic does exist, after all.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Finally, the above photo was taken in 2011, just minutes before Jordan was wheeled into the operating room for her riskiest surgery—one to remove a tumor growing on her spine. We were told there was a 50/50 chance that the surgery alone would render her paralyzed from the waist down. But the risks of doing nothing with the tumor were far greater. As I captured this image, Jordan was losing patience. She wanted to “get it over with.” Her resolve humbled me then as it does now. When I look back on this photo I am filled with the same anxiety and tension that I felt then, but it is mixed with a healthy dose of pride and love for my daughter’s relentless fighting spirit. To me, this is an image of strength and courage. The image I caught 24 hours is, too. It&#8217;s of Jordan taking her first steps after surgery. [&#8230;]]]></wp:comment_content>

<p>Jordan went in for an MRI today. It&rsquo;s the usual process we go through every 3 months. Our nerves are prickly. We expect the worst and hope for the best. Today, we heard that not much has changed. We shouldn&rsquo;t be more worried because nothing&rsquo;s worse. And &hellip; we have very little to cheer us because there&rsquo;s no sign of progress, either.</p>
<p>Jordan handled it the way she always does. She got it done. She had the most positive attitude. And she displayed a dignity, grace and poise that few people twice her age could muster. I thought I&rsquo;d just show you in pictures.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At this holiday time of year, our whole family is grateful for all the love and support we receive. I&rsquo;m often asked how it is that we&rsquo;re so strong. My first response is to say that we draw all our strength from &ldquo;the girl.&rdquo; The truth is more complicated. Jordan guides us and gives us the energy to be optimistic and brave. But we don&rsquo;t travel on this journey alone, and we would be lost without the constant kindness of people we&rsquo;ve known forever and strangers we&rsquo;ve only just met.<br /><br />Holidays are a strange time for our family. No one knows how to behave anymore. We have fragile expectations. We roll through the festivities as easily as we can. This year has been a little harder than others. Neither Jeanette nor I have had much of the holiday spirit. There&rsquo;s no particular reason. We just don&rsquo;t feel it. Jordan&rsquo;s new clinical trial doesn&rsquo;t help. She&rsquo;s doing fine, but she sleeps constantly. She is awake for only a few hours every day, and then she&rsquo;s kind of out of it. It&rsquo;s gotten worse since the doctors added new medication to try and bring her tremors under control. The new meds are essentially muscle relaxers. She&rsquo;s very relaxed, but rarely alert. Since many of Jordan&rsquo;s muscles are still recovering from surgery, the muscle relaxers are creating other problems. She falls a lot because her legs are weaker. And she has &ldquo;accidents&rdquo; in the middle of the night that disrupt her sleep and hurt her self-confidence.<br /><br />Still, when she&rsquo;s awake she&rsquo;s loving and as optimistic as she always is. She had a very nice Christmas. And she&rsquo;s looking forward to the new year. We all are.<br /><br /><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lxydszIeDA1r5aaue.png" /></p>
<p>She was very excited to receive a new handbag for Christmas.</p>
<p><br /><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lxydubag1F1r5aaue.png" /></p>
<p>She&rsquo;s taken to napping on the sofa. Her favorite way is to wrap herself up in a blanket and curl up in a ball with just her hair peeking out.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jordan and I ventured around our block at twilight. Our mission: take pictures of ordinary things and find life in them. She would take pictures seated in the wheelchair, and I&rsquo;d stand. We&rsquo;d look for the differences in our point of view. Here are the results of our photographic journey together.<br /><br />Jordan&rsquo;s is on the left, mine on the right.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyu9513aJi1r5aaue.jpg" /><br /><br />We&rsquo;ve been enjoying a restful Thanksgiving weekend in Palm Springs with our extended family. Jordan finally got to the pool and soaked up some sun. I shot photos of her with her brother and her two cousins on Friday. <br /><br />Chemo is going well. The first cycle is nearly done. Then she gets a week off before going again. She has good days and bad days, but most of the time she&rsquo;s pretty perky. <br /><br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My girl is doing quite well, though chemo saps her energy here and there. When she isn&rsquo;t napping, she charges forward. She went to school most days this week. When she didn&rsquo;t, it was because she had a hard time getting out of bed. Some days she sleeps until the afternoon. But on others, she rises early. Saturday, she was awake before me and she was quite proud when I came downstairs to find her pecking on her iPad.<br /><br />&ndash;Who was the first one up, Dad?<br /><br />The pace of treatment hasn&rsquo;t sapped her spirit, though sometimes she is more reflective. And she worries about all of us. Luc came down with pneumonia this week. He is on the mend, but that didn&rsquo;t stop Jordan from nagging him to dress warmer or drink enough water.<br /><br />Rather than tell you about her present state, I&rsquo;ll just share a few photos from the last week. And this little poem from Emily Dickinson that kept nagging me as I write about Jordan.</p>
<blockquote>To be alive—is Power—<br />Existence—in itself—<br />Without a further function—<br />Omnipotence—Enough—<br /><br />To be alive—and Will!<br />&lsquo;Tis able as a God—<br />The Maker—of Ourselves—be what—<br />Such being Finitude!</blockquote>
<p><br />Last weekend we drove to Palm Springs to visit my mom, who is staying in a house there for the month. We relaxed and lounged around between eating out. It was superb. Jordan enjoyed the visit.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyu979vkCN1r5aaue.jpg" /></p>
<p>Jordan is walking more and more. We only use the wheelchair when we know we&rsquo;ll be out for a long while. Her feet show her effort. They are bruised and battered, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop her. She loves taking off her shoes and letting her toes tickle the air.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyu99fXp9A1r5aaue.jpg" /></p>
<p>She&rsquo;s on at least a dozen medications, and that&rsquo;s partly why she&rsquo;s tired so much. Her new chemotherapy is a clinical trial that requires four different drugs. When traveling, Jeanette packs them all in a lunch box. Seeing them all in one place can be sobering. But Jordan doesn&rsquo;t mind. As long as we serve the pills with chocolate milk, she&rsquo;s cooperative. Better than the IV methods of the past.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyua251lkO1r5aaue.jpg" /></p>
<p><br />Curled up in the hoodie and the fleece blanket is my girl. She sometimes fights the sleep, sitting up in a chair with her eyes battling gravity. I&rsquo;ll ask her if she&rsquo;s tired. &ldquo;Nope!&rdquo; she&rsquo;ll say. Then her eyes droop down and her head nods. I usually have to pick her up and carry her to a sofa or her bed. She&rsquo;ll never go on her own&ndash;she tries to convince herself that she&rsquo;s not tired, and she does a pretty good job.</p>

<p><br />I love this photo and let me tell you why. My slayer is sitting next to me, wearing her cool shades. But on my other side is the coolest kid &ndash; my son Luc. And the shadow of the woman taking the photo is Jeanette. It&rsquo;s such a wonderful depiction of our family. I love them all and I love this photo because they&rsquo;re all there.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><br />What a day!<br /><br />Today, Jordan was invited to be a special guest at the LA Loves Alex&rsquo;s Lemonade Stand event hosted at Culver Studios. It was amazing! She got to meet Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka (the honorary hosts of the event), and Jimmy Kimmel (the event&rsquo;s emcee). We all feasted on delicious food from celebrity chefs, many who flew to LA to participate. And, Jordan gave a speech about her journey for the very first time. She was fantastic.<br /><br />I have not posted to the Journey for some time because life has been very busy&ndash;fortunately, the busyness had little to do with cancer. Last week, I finally delivered the manuscript for my next book to the publisher. Phew! With that out of the way, I am looking forward to sharing more family adventures with my favorite cancer slayer. <br /><br />Jordan is doing very well. She is back to school and she&rsquo;s very active. Occasionally, she has to deal with seizures, but (knock wood) she generally feels great. She is certainly in great spirits.<br /><br />Though she&rsquo;s feeling well and continuing a great recovery from the August surgery, she&rsquo;s still doing battle with the beast. In her last MRI, it was hard to tell whether or not the spinal tumor was completely gone. Based on the images and data, it&rsquo;s possible the tumor is still growing. We certainly think the tumors in her brain are still active, though fortunately, they are not progressing rapidly. This week Jordan will begin a clinical trial for a new chemotherapy protocol. She&rsquo;s happy that it is all with pills, but she will have to go to CHLA a bit more for blood work and routine tests. <br /><br />I&rsquo;m very proud of her and her constant courage. Sometimes, I worry that the realities of living with cancer are taking a toll on her confidence. When she learns of setbacks in her health, she takes the news very hard. It&rsquo;s not that she feels sorry for herself or allows herself to be sad the way most of us would naturally do. She gets frustrated that she hasn&rsquo;t done enough to keep the cancer away. Jeanette and I keep counseling her as much as we can. We keep saying, &ldquo;this isn&rsquo;t your fault. You&rsquo;re doing more than most anyone could do.&rdquo; We think we&rsquo;re getting through, but then she&rsquo;ll say something like, &ldquo;why won&rsquo;t my body do a better job kicking cancer&rsquo;s butt?&rdquo; I feel bad when she says this. I&rsquo;ve been the guy who keeps propping her up as a &ldquo;cancer slayer.&rdquo; I thought it would help (and I think it has) but I wonder sometimes if I haven&rsquo;t made her think she has more control over her health than she really does.<br /><br />While she and I were sitting on the steps of the stage this afternoon, waiting to be introduced for our speech together, Jordan whispered to me, &ldquo;Dad, I don&rsquo;t have cancer anymore, do I?&rdquo; Behind us, Liz Scott was sharing the inspiring story of her daughter Alex with the crowd. I think something in that story struck Jordan because her question came out of the blue. I whispered back, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re still fighting, honey.&rdquo;<br /><br />She looked back at me with concern.<br /><br />&ndash;I have cancer again?<br /><br />I&rsquo;ve had this conversation with Jordan before. The trouble this time was that we were seated in front of 300 people and we were about to be called up to talk to the audience.<br /><br />&ndash;Honey, we can talk about this in a little bit, okay?<br /><br />&ndash;I have cancer again?<br /><br />Her beautiful blue eyes demanded an answer. I whispered back.<br /><br />&ndash;It never went away, I said.<br /><br />I thought for a minute she might cry, and I was trying to figure out what I&rsquo;d do next. But I underestimated her again. She put her head on her knees and I put my arm around her. In the background, I could hear Liz finishing the story of how Alex&rsquo;s Lemonade Stand came to be. I knew it was just a minute or two before we&rsquo;d hear our names.<br /><br />&ndash;That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re here, Jordan. We&rsquo;re here to tell people about how you keep kicking cancer&rsquo;s butt.<br /><br />She gave me a very small smile, and then it was our turn to share our story with the crowd.<br />During my speech, I looked over at Jordan a few times. She smiled and stood proudly. When it was time for me to introduce her, she stepped in front of the microphone, thanked everyone for coming to the event, and enlisted their support.<br /><br />&ndash;Let&rsquo;s kick cancer&rsquo;s butt together, she said.<br /><br />Then she talked about having a birthday party in the hospital and making new friends. She was brilliant and I was very proud of her. We all were. <br /><br />&ndash;<br /><br />I do a lot of speaking, but I don&rsquo;t usually get to speak about Jordan&rsquo;s Journey. It was actually hard to prepare my remarks, but here&rsquo;s how I introduced her:<br /><br />This is the best way to drink lemonade, here on the steps of Tara surrounded by so many of our heroes. I&rsquo;m excited to be here and I&rsquo;m proud that I get to introduce you to Jordan. You&rsquo;re going to hear a few words from her in a minute, but before you do I want to warn you&hellip;<br /><br />A lot of times, when I introduce Jordan to new people they&rsquo;re a little unprepared for her energy. She&rsquo;s a force to be reckoned with. She often likes to tell people all the nicknames I&rsquo;ve called her since she was an infant. She&rsquo;ll tell you that I call her snuggle bug, snicklefritz and sugar bug. But she often says them so fast that they come out like one long word that sounds like supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. By the time you&rsquo;ve sorted it out, she will have moved on to a new topic. That is the beautiful quality that I think I love most about my daughter: her take-no-prisoners attitude. She is a force of will and that has quite literally saved her life.<br /><br />You see, Jordan has fought cancer for over eight years. At 13, that&rsquo;s more than half of her life spent in treatment. She&rsquo;s battled the beast with chemotherapy, with radiation, and with more surgeries than we care to remember. Brain and spinal tumors are tenacious beasts. But they really pale in comparison to the awesome strength of my sugarbug-snicklefitz-snuggle-bug.<br /><br />For example, the day Jordan woke up after cancer forced her into a week-long coma, she simply smiled at me and asked, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s for breakfast, Dad?&rdquo; She was back at school a week later. When rare complications from chemotherapy crippled her and put her in a wheelchair, Jordan not only learned to walk again, she scaled a rock wall on a family vacation. Jordan amazes us every day. She never gives up and she seldom lets cancer get her down. She really does make lemonade out of life&rsquo;s lemons. That&rsquo;s why I started blogging about all the things she does on her journey, because her spirit is infectious. She&rsquo;s my modern-day Auntie Mame&ndash;a fighter who believes that life is a banquet and most poor suckers are starving.<br /><br />Let me tell you another one of Jordan&rsquo;s nicknames&ndash;one that she and I coined together. We say she&rsquo;s a cancer slayer. We came up with this title last year when, after a brief period of remission, her doctors discovered a new tumor growing in her spine. The scariest part was the fact that she needed a risky surgical procedure. We were told that there was a 50/50 chance she would be paralyzed from the waist down just by having surgery. We discussed what to do as a family, and even Jordan agreed that the risks were far too great if we didn&rsquo;t operate. For years, Jordan&rsquo;s been proud to tell anyone who&rsquo;d listen that she&rsquo;s &ldquo;kicking cancer&rsquo;s butt.&rdquo; When she gave her approval to proceed with surgery, we decided she&rsquo;d kicked it enough to be known officially as a &ldquo;slayer.&rdquo; We even made t-shirts.<br /><br />Alex&rsquo;s Lemonade Stand Foundation is one of our favorite causes because it attracts a community of slayers. It&rsquo;s founded on the belief that we <em>can</em> find a cure for <em>all</em> children with cancer. While there are many children who wake up every day determined to kick cancer&rsquo;s butt, they thrive when they know they have supporters like all of you&ndash;people who generously give time, money and so much encouragement. Together, we can slay childhood cancer. Thank you for all that you do, and thank you for being here today.<br /><br />And now, I&rsquo;d like to introduce you to my slayer&hellip;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I have been holed up in a room finishing chapters for my book for the last 3 weeks. This morning, as I was plugging away, I got this photo from Jordan in a text message. When I asked her about it later, she said, &ldquo;I just thought you might like to see the outfit I picked out.&rdquo;<br /><br />I did.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think I worried some of you because I&rsquo;ve been so quiet. Things are good. I&rsquo;ve been completely preoccupied in the final sprint to finish my book &hellip; and Jordan has continued her inspiring recovery. She goes to school nearly every day. She uses the walker and sometimes the wheelchair, but mostly she tries to do more and more with her legs, and they mostly cooperate. <br /><br />She came downstairs tonight to sit with me for a bit. I love our conversations. They&rsquo;re pretty random, but they&rsquo;re also punctuated with periods of silence, where we just sit together and enjoy each other&rsquo;s company. I look over at her and she smiles back. That makes me smile. A vicious, smiling circle ensues. Then we gab about something topical. <br /><br />It&rsquo;s good to have her home. It&rsquo;s good to have her being her.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first text message buzzed my phone at 6:56am. I was at the office already, rewriting a chapter for my book. The message was from Jordan and it said, &ldquo;JV.&rdquo; This is her code she sometimes sends me when she wants me to call her, but it is just as often sent when she&rsquo;s bored and wants to say hello. Because it was so early, I assumed it was the latter and sent back the word &lsquo;love,&rsquo; as I often do.<br /><br />Two minutes later, another text message streamed through—this one a picture of her mother sitting in a cafe. I thought it was odd, but I played along. I took a picture of myself sitting at my desk, waving to her. &ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; I thought. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s bored.&rdquo;<br /><br />Fifteen minutes later Jeanette texts me. &ldquo;Jordan&rsquo;s coming home today.&rdquo;<br /><br />I will try to temper my frustration at the always spontaneous and frequently disorganized crew at Childrens Hospital so that I can do a happy dance. My daughter is coming home today. Not on a day pass. For good. After evaluating her this morning, her lead doctor has decided that she&rsquo;s strong enough to continue her therapy as an out-patient. We are thrilled to have her back. Thank you to everyone who helped us get through the last month. Jordan appreciated all of your thoughtful messages and frequent visits.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reason would dictate that pit bosses in Vegas should shun Jordan from their tables. She&rsquo;s the one who statistically should hit it big any time she plays the odds. Less than 1% of children are diagnosed with brain tumors each year. Of that tiny percentage, even less are diagnosed with neuroglial tumors like Jordan&rsquo;s. Vincristine, one of the first chemotherapy drugs she used early in her treatment is one of the most widely diagnosed in protocols. Less than 3% of patients who take Vincristine develop serious side effects. Of course, Jordan was in that 3% minority which led to the nerve damage in her legs. So it should be no surprise that the latest step in her journey is a statistical outlier.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve previously written about the leg and arm spasms Jordan has endured. Unlike the seizures, Jordan is fully conscious when her extermities begin trembling and spasming. We&rsquo;ve tried a few drug therapies, but they have either proven ineffective or they produced unpleasant side effects. The condition has progressed into something even more rare. A few weeks ago, her legs began lifting up in involuntary rhythmic movements. We&rsquo;re not talking about spasms. These are full-fledged extensions of her leg. She looks like she&rsquo;s imitating the &ldquo;silly walk&rdquo; of Monty Python fame. In fact, the first time I saw it I told Jordan to stop kidding around. But there was nothing funny about it. When these motions begin she has no control of her leg, and it terrifies her. Just looking at her face you can see how concerned she is that her body is out of her control.</p>

<p>The doctors believe that Jordan has developed West&rsquo;s syndrome, a very rare neurological condition that causes parts of the body to convulse severely. It was known for many years as Salaam Attacks because as it progresses some patients developed involuntary spasms of the head and torso that resembled the ceremonial bowing of Eastern religions. You guessed it, Jordan has developed this rarity as well. She&rsquo;s not in any pain, but when these attacks come on she says &ldquo;it completely freaks me out.&rdquo; She is able to talk with us in the midst of the attack, and she tells us that she&rsquo;s embarrassed and that she wished her body would stop doing this. It makes me sad to hear her distressed, but her complaints are more angry than sad. She gets frustrated with her noncompliant body.</p>

<p>We have three neurologists working on the case. They&rsquo;re changing her medication and planning to study with additional tests. We&rsquo;ll all be paying particular attention to her next MRI, which is scheduled for the first week in April, to look for signs of further tumor advancement. It&rsquo;s possible that the condition has developed because the cancer is on the move again. </p>

<p>Other than the occasional attacks, Jordan is upbeat. She goes to school most days and her mood has been good. She&rsquo;s been off chemo for three weeks because her counts were too low. The doctors decided to let her coast until after the MRI, which suits her fine. She loves when life is mostly normal. I&rsquo;ve decided to use some of this downtime to teach her how to play cards because one day in the future she and I will give Vegas a run for its money.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A.D. = After Diagnosis. This photo is B.C., but only slightly. Jeanette took this photo the afternoon before Jordan went in for a biopsy &ndash; on Thursday, October 7th, 2004. It was the day before we learned that Jordan had cancer. We half-suspected this was the case, which is why Jeanette took Jordan out to play. In my writing these past few weeks I&rsquo;ve been tracing history. This photo is an important memento for our family. It&rsquo;s not an end. It&rsquo;s a beginning.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a fantastic article on the strange way that pets and humans have a healing relationship. I believe it because Jordan has enjoyed pet therapy on a number of occasions, and I&rsquo;ve seen her do miraculous things when pets are present. For instance, she was in a coma, and yet when the therapy dog paid a visit she bolted upright in her bed. See the photos for proof.</p>

While Jeanette and Luc finished their meals, Jordan and I took a walk over to the field. We watched planes take-off and land. Jordan got so excited. It didn&rsquo;t matter that the wind was gusty and tinged with a little briskness. She stood up and leaned over the rail to get a closer look. Even though she said she wasn&rsquo;t cold, I threw my jacket over her to keep her warm.</p>

<p class="caption">Awhile later, Jeanette and Luc joined us and Jeanette snapped this picture. It was a fun afternoon.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Jordan: (inspecting the pasta in her dish) Why did you disobey me?
Jeanette: What?
Jordan: Why did you disobey me?
Jeanette: I have no idea what you're talking about, but that's not how you talk to me.
Jordan: I told you what I wanted for dinner. This isn't it.
Jeanette: Change your tone. (exits)
I walk downstairs, hungry.
Me: Jordan, would you like me to make you a sausage patty.
Jordan: (cheerfully) Sure, Dad.
(I then make said chicken sausage patty with a bit of apple sauce and seasonings. I bring to Jordan).
Jordan: Thanks, Dad. This is so good. You know exactly what I like to eat, don't you, Dad?
(Jeanette taps foot in the corner)
Moral of the story -- Daddy rocks.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You have probably noticed that Jordan&rsquo;s Journey doesn&rsquo;t look or feel like it did before. Here&rsquo;s the scoop: our site was hacked twice. After the second time, I gave up on our hosting service and migrated Jordan&rsquo;s Journey to Tumblr. In the long-run, the move to Tumblr should provide us with more opportunities to share Jordan&rsquo;s story with all of you. In the short-run, it will be a headache.</p>
<ul><li>If you follow us by RSS feed, you&rsquo;ll need to update your link. It has changed.</li>
<li>You will notice that there are many broken links, especially to images. In time, we&rsquo;ll get those fixed.</li>
<li>All comments are gone. This pains me because so many of you have written encouraging and fantastic notes to us over the years. We have all of them here to read when we need inspiration, but we can&rsquo;t port them to the new site at the moment. If you want to leave comments in the future, we&rsquo;re enabling Disqus, which will allow you to send your cheers and thoughts like you always have. (We love those, by the way!)</li>
<li>The design is an off-the-shelf theme, but we intend to make this new Tumblr home look, in the words of the slayer herself, &ldquo;perfectly Jordan&rdquo;</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

This week, our family could not refuse the offer to give Jordan a pint of blood. Her counts had dipped on several fronts, so it was time to give her a boost. And boy did it ever! She has been bubbly all weekend, smiling and hanging out. She hasn&rsquo;t been napping all day like last week. Instead, she&rsquo;s chatty and alert. Meanwhile, I&rsquo;ve been teasing her that she must be part vampire. I get the same response.<br />&ndash; Very funny, Dad.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9039099668816362935-938047449120815468?l=jordansjourney2.blogspot.com" alt="" /></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The slayer is not well. I have little to say. She barely knew I was there when I stopped by to visit. She greeted me with an odd remark about a friend she has not seen in over a year. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been saying that to everyone,&rdquo; Jeanetted confided.</p>

<p>While I stayed with her, Jordan sat in her bed with her arms at her side. She kept staring up at the corner of the room with a crooked smile on her face. Whenever we asked how she was she simply said, &ldquo;good.&rdquo; Nothing else.</p>

<p>She has been off Depakote for three days but her mental state seems to be getting worse. It makes me very sad. I miss my girl.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jordan was admitted to CHLA today. She fell while descending the stairs at home and hit her head. Given her history with head trauma, we were instructed to bring her in to the hospital even though she was fine after the fall. She&rsquo;s resting comfortably but she&rsquo;s going to be in the hospital for at least a few days while the doctors run tests and observe her to try and explain the change in her physical condition.</p>
<p>Her motor skills have deteriorated significantly in the past few days. Her legs were practically useless for much of the weekend. They were about as useful to support her weight as overcooked spaghetti. We think the deterioration might be related to changes in her medication. As the dosing increased she lost more motor function. She also became very listless. On Sunday, she was only half-present most of the day, staring up at a corner of the room glassy-eyed with a dull smile. Instead of her usual chattiness, she&rsquo;d sit quietly. To be truthful, it was very hard for me. It&rsquo;s jarring when Jordan isn&rsquo;t Jordan.</p>
<p>By Monday she had to crawl from room to room, and her arms began to weaken. She collapsed in the upstairs hallway while trying to crawl to the bathroom. We consulted with her neurologist immediately and we pulled her off the new medication. She seemed to be bouncing back somewhat yesterday, though she wasn&rsquo;t able to go to school. Today started off well. She felt strong enough to walk on her own two feet with some help. But she lost her balance coming down the stairs. She hit her head so hard her right eye is black and blue. She had a cat scan tonight and we relieved to learn there&rsquo;s no sign of internal bleeding. She&rsquo;s still listless and she fades in and out of sleep, but she seems to be doing well otherwise. We&rsquo;ll have a better sense in the morning when she can be evaluated by her medical team.</p>
<p>Thank you to all who have reached out to see if we need anything. We&rsquo;re all doing ok. I&rsquo;ll report in with new information when I have it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>A pantoum</em>

Love has never dwelled so hard in my heart.
She softens my soul when she is near
And empties it in absence
Such that I have never loved nor feared its loss before.

When she is near she softens my soul.
I am not the me that I think I am.
I have so never loved nor feared I’d lose so much before
Because her smile enriches my eager heart.

I am not the me I think that I am.
My life is ever changed because of her.
My heart is rich because of her eager smile
That carries me and makes me strong enough to weep.

Because of her, my life is ever changed.
It is empty in her absence.
I weep enough to have the strength to carry on.
I will not harden my heart so that my love may ever dwell.]]></content:encoded>

Chemo has started again. We&rsquo;re in that weird period where she&rsquo;s in between medications&ndash;an effort to smooth out the seizures. We were able to go out to lunch yesterday, and a movie today. There are times when she checks out or is listless. But for the most part, she perks along like the Jordan we adore.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A Sense of Humor</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We hang together in the master bedroom, watching <i>Ferris Bueller&rsquo;s Day Off</i>; she, Jeanette and I. We&rsquo;re relaxed. It&rsquo;s been a delightful day. It&rsquo;s my birthday and I&rsquo;ve basked in a stream of well-wishes from my friends and family. I&rsquo;ve also been the beneficiary of unbridled affection from the slayer. Now, in the early evening, we&rsquo;re enjoying the quiet pleasure of shared time in front of the boob tube. Then it starts.</p>

<p>First, her left leg kicks high, toes pointed. Just as quickly as it rises straight and stiff, it slams down on to the bed. It smacks down percussively. I&rsquo;m actually startled at first because there was no warning and the landing thuds over the movie dialog. Then the leg lifts again, and just as quickly slams down. Jordan turns her head to look at me.<br /><br />
&ndash; Here we go again, she says.</p>

<p>I have to smile as I climb onto the bed to soothe her legs. I don&rsquo;t like to restrain her, but I also don&rsquo;t want her to hurt herself. As surreal as it seems, she has no control over her leg. She&rsquo;s only along for the ride; as much a spectator to the show as we are. It makes me wonder how people would have interpreted such behavior hundreds of years ago. In another time, you&rsquo;d conclude that she was possessed by spirits. No sooner do I think this than her hips begin twisting. She rotates her leg from side to side. We&rsquo;ve never seen her do this before. Without the slightest sense of irony she observes her shimmying middle and says it for us.</p>

<p>&ndash; That&rsquo;s new!</p>

<p>You might be reading this and thinking how sad it all is, which is why I must assure you that we laughed when Jordan said this. In a way, she dissolved the tension in the room. She has a lovely sense of humor and a healthy point of view. I had to give her a giant kiss on the cheek before I helped her keep her shoulders down. Her body quieted eventually, and we finished our private screening of the John Hughes comedy classic. As much as Ferris makes me laugh, I&rsquo;m still giggling about my girl. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s new!&rdquo; She was the bigger hit that night.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We got the results from the Slayer&rsquo;s MRI yesterday. Overall, looks stable. One area might have some growth, but hard to say because it&rsquo;s small. She&rsquo;ll be back on chemo when her counts are stronger. She&rsquo;s still a little low. She&rsquo;s also coming back to CHLA for a few days so the neurology team can observe her in an effort to solve the issues with seizures and spasms. </p>

<p>Jordan was upbeat. When she called me she said, &ldquo;I just really want some sushi.&rdquo;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Hello, April</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6033/7036487507_6c5a7e961c_z.jpg" width="500" /></p>
<p>The sun showers her hair as she leans across the railing of our third floor patio. She rests her head on her hand, with an elbow braced against the iron, and rambles on about a playdate she plans with a new friend. She has quilted me with random observations and anecdotes for the past 20 minutes. Each patch of one-sided conversation is stitched to the next with an obligatory silence. She knows that I have come here to write. She promised not to bother me. And she doesn&rsquo;t &hellip; for a half minute at a time.</p>
<p>I ditch my keyboard and peck between sites on my iPad, resigned to the fact that writing will have to wait. Instead, I decide to listen and enjoy the lilting musings of my slayer. She&rsquo;s in a great mood today. It&rsquo;s been a rough week, but you&rsquo;d scarcely know it from the smile on her face and the delightful cheer in her voice. On this beautiful afternoon in Santa Monica, the sun has no finer companion than my girl.</p>
<p>Jordan&rsquo;s neurosystem reminds me of a lovable old car. Sometimes it starts. At other times, you have to coax it, stroke it and give it tender loving care to get from point A to point B. She&rsquo;s had more than a few seizures this week. They vary in their severity, but quickly subside after a little medication and time to rest. More troublesome are the spasms. They wake her at night and catch her off guard when she&rsquo;s least expecting it. Jeanette has spent more than a few nights in Jordan&rsquo;s room, laying with her to comfort her while her body jerks without her permission.</p>
<p>The spasms are an odd lot. She&rsquo;ll be talking to you one minute with her body relaxed, and the next minute her arms and legs start shaking restlessly. Like an orchestra, they play their part and gradually build until her head and upper body add to the crescendo, slamming her forward and back so violently that she gets a headache. Since Jordan is fully conscious during these episodes, we receive a running commentary, which ranges from complete frustration to exasperated annoyance.</p>

<p>This morning, when her head began bobbing uncontrollably, she whined lightly.</p>
<p>&ndash; Oh, maaaaan. Why does my head do this?</p>
<p>&ndash; I&rsquo;m sorry, honey. Please sit down.</p>
<p>I took her hand and walked her to the sofa. She toed her way over like a disabled crane, all while her head nodded back and forth as though she were vehemently agreeing with me on something of great importance. I sat her down and put a pillow behind her head to soften the blows.</p>
<p>&ndash; Is that more comfortable?</p>
<p>She answered with a crooked grimace. </p>
<p>&ndash; This is so annoying.</p>
<p>But now she is leaning against the rail looking quite lovely and making the world look quite lovely in the background. As much as I&rsquo;m nervous about not getting some words on the page, I relish moments like these with Jordan.</p>
<p>A soft wind has kicked up and we both remark how great it feels to have it blow over us. I hope this latest setback in Jordan&rsquo;s health will blow over just as softly &hellip; and that I can enjoy many more moments like this with her. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a waste to chase the pipe dream of a magical tiny theory that allows us to make quick and detailed calculations about the future. We can&rsquo;t predict and we can&rsquo;t control. To accept this can be a source of liberation and inner peace. We&rsquo;re part of the unfolding world, surfing the chaotic waves.</p>
<p class="alignright"><span class="red">//</span> Rudy Rucker,<br />&ldquo;The World is Unpredictable&rdquo;<br />in <em>This Will Make You Smarter</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ndash; What is my name?</p>
<p>She searches the hall with restless eyes. They find many targets but none are me. After a few moments she says, &ldquo;Dad.&rdquo; It is then that she looks at me, but contact with her cool blue eyes is fleeting. She studies me just long enough to acknowledge that she answered right. Then her eyes continue their scan of the long hallway in which she, Jeanette and I sit on the floor. She is wrapped in two towels and her hair is wet. Minutes earlier, she experienced a long, intense seizure while taking a bath. We are waiting for her brain to finish rebooting. She has only just now started speaking again.</p>
<p>&ndash; That&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;m Dad. What do people call me?</p>
<p>She looks at me again for only an instant. Her face is painted with a defeated expression. We know that in this state Jordan is only half with us. I imagine that inside she is clawing her way out of the haze. She struggles to make some sounds before the word comes out.</p>
<p>&ndash; Dad.</p>
<p>I ask her what her grandmother&rsquo;s name is. She responds, &ldquo;grandpa.&rdquo; When we ask her the dog&rsquo;s name, she says, &ldquo;dog.&rdquo; By the way that she struggles to make the words and the way that she nervously fidgets while trying to respond, I sense a tiny part of her knows her responses are wrong. It must be frightening and annoying to command your body to respond only to hear it misstep with your own ears.</p>
<p>Less than an hour beforehand she and I talked about our plans for the day. Her tummy was bothering her, but it didn&rsquo;t stop her from pecking me on the cheek to wish me a good morning. She was talkative and eager to take a bath. I went downstairs to do some writing while Jeanette got the bath ready for Jordan. Awhile later I heard the shouting. Jeanette was calling my name loudly in a way that she only does when something isn&rsquo;t right. </p>
<p>I ran up the stairs and stepped inside the bathroom to see Jeanette struggling to hold Jordan still. Jordan&rsquo;s eyes were dilated wide and she was squirming and trying to stand up. Some of her body was shaking, but this seizure was mostly about absence&ndash;Jordan was gone. Her body was here, and it was very animated, but our daughter was somewhere else. When she tried to speak, she spoke in loud whispers. Her words were full of gibberish. She was trying to say something, but it sounded like she was possessed. What spewed from her mouth weren&rsquo;t words at all, just slurred morphemes that might pass for a foreign language if not for the fact that it was a pure stream of misfires from her over-heated synapses. When she wasn&rsquo;t trying to stand up or speak in tongues, she tried to roll-over and lay down. It took all of Jeanette&rsquo;s strength to tame her.</p>
<p>I reached over to the other side of the tub and opened the drain. Somehow, in Jordan&rsquo;s removed state she retained her modesty. She tried to cover herself with her hands. I actually think the words she was trying to produce for her mother were to ask for a towel. I looked away, of course, but that wasn&rsquo;t enough for my girl. </p>
<p>When the water had drained some and Jordan&rsquo;s movements were somewhat less subdued, I suggested that we lift her out of the tub. I lifted her from under her arms and then carried her in my arms to the hallway. My clothes were soaked as we lay her down and covered her with towels. Her right leg spasmed wildly, lifting off the ground now and again. When I pressed my palm to her thigh her muscles twitched as though a strong electric current pulsed through them. </p>
<p>We did our best to dry Jordan and keep her warm. She moved her head a bit in bird-like motions, digesting the scene with her wide eyes but really taking nothing in at all. She still could not really speak. Instead, she&rsquo;d occasionally make a sucking sound in her cheek while her teeth chattered rapidly. She had all the mannerisms of a malfunctioning cyborg. I imagined this would be the expected behavior if we had put a robot in the tub.</p>
<p>Slowly, gradually, Jordan made her way back to us as her body settled down. She began responding to our questions. Some she got right. Others, were pathetic misses. It is always, always hard for me to watch these mental hurricanes. My mind races in a different way than hers. First, I imagine how horrible it would be if this was her permanent state&ndash;how sad I would be to have her here but not here. Then, my head races to conclusions&ndash;is her condition deteriorating? Her seizures have come more frequently. She&rsquo;s been having new neurological issues like the chorea and onset of West&rsquo;s syndrome. Do these data points predict further decline? My mind races next to solutions&ndash;which doctors do we need to consult; is it time to find new insight? While all these thoughts race to my mind, Jordan begins to be Jordan again. </p>
<p>I step away and Jeanette helps Jordan dress. By the time I return to her room she is sitting up on her bed in a pair of comfortable pajamas. She has found her iPad and she taps and scrolls with determined voracity. She spends such little time on each page she visits that I&rsquo;m not sure she&rsquo;s absorbing any of the content. This browsing behavior appears to be her proving to herself that she can function again. When we speak to her, she makes more sense and she can remember more names, but her speech is badly slurred. It doesn&rsquo;t look like the left side of her mouth is cooperating. Still, she has improved. I ask if she wants another blanket and she shoos me away for bothering her too much.</p>
<p>15 minutes later I pay her another visit and find her exactly as I expect. She has rolled over to one side curled up in a ball on her bed, covered with her favorite blanket. She is sound asleep. The only thing we can reliably predict when her neural network reboots is that she will turn all the other systems off to complete the reset. She sleeps for several hours. When she wakes, it is as if nothing happened at all &hellip; and she remembers nothing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Love has never dwelled so hard in my heart.<br />She softens my soul when she is near<br />And empties it in absence<br />Such that I have never loved nor feared its loss before.</p>
<p>When she is near she softens my soul<br />I am not the me that I think I am.<br />I have so never loved nor feared I&rsquo;d lose so much before<br />Because her smile enriches my gentle heart.</p>
<p>I am not the me I think that I am.<br />My life is ever changed because of her.<br />My heart is rich because of her gentle smile<br />That carries me and makes me strong enough to weep.</p>
<p>Because of her, my life is ever changed.<br />It is empty in her absence.<br />I weep enough to have the strength to carry on.<br />I will not harden my heart so that my love may ever dwell.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Back to Uptime Jordan</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She glides her fingers across the track pad of the MacBook she shares with her mother. The white earbud cords dangle from her ears like costume jewelry. She is watching a video on &ldquo;how to wash a pug&rdquo; with a cheerful smile and a raised brow. She often comments about the content as if I were sitting next to her listening to the same audio &ndash; but of course I&rsquo;m not. So, every so often the silence in the room is punctuated by Jordan in a loud voice.</p>
<p>&ndash;Isn&rsquo;t that interesting, Dad?</p>
<p>&ndash;Honey, I can&rsquo;t hear what you&rsquo;re hearing.</p>
<p>&ndash;If you use more water the pug&rsquo;s coat will absorb it.</p>
<p>I stare back at her blankly.</p>
<p>&ndash;That&rsquo;s very interesting</p>
<p>She says this matter-of-factly and then re-engrosses with her video. The full visage of her face is obscured by giant ringlets of hair. She gets tired of brushing them out of her eyes so half the time I feel that I am talking to a shaggy dog, or Cousin Itt. No matter, though. She is radiant these days. She&rsquo;s gained some much-needed weight and her skin is full of color. The blush is back in her cheeks and the fire has returned to her eyes.<!-- more --></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all enjoyed the last two weeks with our Slayer back at home. She&rsquo;s gone to school most days, except for the occasion or two when she battled a headache or thwarted a seizure. The seizures come frequently&ndash;about one every other day. On most days she just has auras. These disrupt her energetic pace, but don&rsquo;t discourage her. We&rsquo;ve learned to dismiss and trivialize the seizures. Jordan responds better that way. There&rsquo;s no surer way to make her worry than for us to make too much of a fuss or overly-pamper her.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;ve gotten any easier for Jeanette or I. When Jordan had a large seizure midweek both of us were shaken and sad. True to form, when it had passed Jordan asked to go to bed and she slept for hours only to wake and want to tackle the next day. Though it may seem absurd, this is normal for us and we welcome the return of &ldquo;uptime Jordan.&rdquo; Sitting here in the living room with her I am kissed with conversational oddities, caressed with dizzy riddles that make me giggle, and courted by random pleasantries that always end in requests for affirmation.</p>
<p>&ndash;We do like to sit here and listen to music, don&rsquo;t we, Dad?</p>
<p>&ndash;We do.</p>
<p>&ndash;And this is a lovely day, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>&ndash;It is.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Jordan is doing much better. She&rsquo;s still at CHLA and probably will be for another week or so. She&rsquo;s much more alert and like herself. Unfortunately, the seizures have been coming on stronger in the last day. Nevertheless, she&rsquo;s in good spirits and she&rsquo;s appreciated all the love she&rsquo;s received from her friends.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="Jordan, Fighting On" height="500" src="http://distilleryimage2.instagram.com/0c3618e2923e11e18cf91231380fd29b_7.jpg" width="500" /></p>
<p><br />Slowly, methodically, she is coming back to us.</p>
<p>When Luc and I arrived for a visit today we found her reclined in her bed very much engaged in a television program. She was still subdued and laconic, but the dazed, catatonic wanderings that set us worrying are more or less a vestige of yesterday. Today, she held a conversation and seemed quite pleased to be present at a family gathering, no matter that it unfolded in a sixth floor hospital room.</p>
<p>She is tired of wearing the bandages on her head. They conceal a thicket of wires and electrodes monitoring her brain waves. She has had to wear her mummy headdress since Wednesday. When she was absent, it annoyed her but she was too out of it to make much of a fuss. Now, with her spirit returning, she scowels whenever she is reminded about it.</p>
<p>Across from her, a computer spits out data from her head while a camera captures her every move. Whenever her leg begins to shake or her arms jerk uncontrolably, or she lapses into a daze, Jeanette scurries over to the computer, hits a button and makes a note of what she has observed. In this fashion, it is hard for me to tell which of my two girls is the true lab rat.</p>
<p>I suppose it is the cruelest twist of irony that Jordan has not experienced nearly the turbulent spasms that started this whole adventure&ndash;the spasms we wish to capture on camera and in the endless ticker flow of electrode data. Tomorrow, the doctors have to remove the wires and the bandages because five days is the maximum allowed study period. This has led to some odd turns of phrase from my beautiful wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really hope we get some good jerks,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Jordan agreed with her.</p>
<p>Last night, I tweeted to USC quarterback Matt Barkley. I told him that Jordan was thinking of him as she was coming back to us. She was fighting on. I didn&rsquo;t really expect a reply. I don&rsquo;t know Matt, personally. I&rsquo;m just a loyal Trojan and I have admired his play on many Saturdays while my Slayer sat next to me. She has a mad crush on him. She follows his Instagram feed and often says to me, &ldquo;that Matt Barkley sure is handsome.&rdquo; All season long last year she rooted for him with great aplomb. When the plays were tough, she&rsquo;d shout out &ldquo;come on, Matt Barkley!&rdquo; She really does say his whole name. When she doesn&rsquo;t she just refers to his number. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me down, number 7,&rdquo; she&rsquo;ll say.</p>
<p>I was settling in for bed about an hour after I tweeted out to him when my phone started chirping. I ignored it at first. I figured it was just the usual late night follower, since I&rsquo;ve been busy tweeting about brands for my book. But then it kept chirping. When I picked it up I was thrilled to see that Matt retweeted my message and replied that he was praying for Jordan. After that, tons of people I didn&rsquo;t know started retweeting and following Jordan&rsquo;s Journey. It was really amazing. I couldn&rsquo;t wait to see her today to share his message.</p>
<p>Her smile beamed! She said, &ldquo;oh, that is SO nice of him to wish me well.&rdquo; Then she looked kind of coy with a giant, genuine smile on her face. I couldn&rsquo;t be more proud to be a Trojan and to enjoy the support of my extended USC family. I&rsquo;m very grateful to everyone for lifting my girl&rsquo;s spirits. It meant so much to her and to me.</p>
<p>Jordan has never been much of a goodbye girl, so I try not to take her coldness personally when I say farewell for the night. She gave me the usual brush of the shoulder tonight, but not before letting me kiss her on the cheek and wish her sweet dreams. &ldquo;I love you, too, Daddy,&rdquo; she said dryly when I whispered to her. But then she looked into my eyes for a moment and I could clearly see that my girl was in there and marching her way back. She rolled over after that and began drifting into sleep. I left feeling, for the first time in days, a hint of relief.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not anywhere near the finish line. There are more tests and a bumpy road ahead as we experiment with medications. Many of her anti-seizure meds are reduced, so she is at an increased risk for severe seizures. We&rsquo;ve also been advised that she may have to check back into in-patient physical therapy. But for now, I&rsquo;m comforted by the return of my Slayer&rsquo;s spirit, if only just the slightest percolation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Comforting Dream</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have a recurring dream. It’s the kind that seems so vivid you tell yourself in your dream that it’s only a dream, but then you don’t wake up and you begin to think (in your dream) that it’s real. This is a dream about Jordan and hope and being a dad.

In my dream, it is Jordan’s wedding day and I am not very happy. I grumble that Jordan needs special care. I assume the boy hasn’t thought any of this marriage thing through and that my daughter is going to get hurt. I suspect his motives. Sometimes Jeanette agrees with me. At other times she counsels me to try and let Jordan live her life.

“That’s what we’ve always wanted,” she says.

I can picture the room. It’s darker than I would expect for a wedding reception. People are at tables laughing and carrying on. I overhear some of them.

“She looks so beautiful,” I hear one say.

“I never thought I’d see this day,” another opines.

“Her family is so strong.”

“Every time I think about what she’s been through, I just get so happy that she’s well … and look at her!”

And I do. I look across the room and see her standing arched over a table of doting admirers. Her now-husband is at her side. She is radiant–a commanding presence that fills the room. She’s a grown woman in this dream, but I still see my little girl. I see that wide smile and those brilliant eyes. I can still see her cheekiness mixed in with a newfound maturity. There’s something quite lovely about the way she stands next to her groom. There’s something that gives me comfort … and I tell myself to stop liking it.

Sometimes, in my dream this part mixes up. I remember one night I dreamt that I sat at a table next to my mother. She tells me how proud she is of me and how well my girl turned out. I deflect and ask her if she thinks the groom will be able to provide well for Jordan. I get that smirky look from my mom that tells me I’m being too ornery.

Sometimes, in this part of my dream, I leave the party and walk around in a place I don’t recognize. There are halls and halls and I walk around them by myself admiring artwork and wandering for no good reason. I can still hear the muffled sound of the party. Then Luc is walking with me and we chat about nothing.

What happens next is always the same. I am in the room and the music is going and I ask Jordan to dance. We walk out onto the dance floor and a soulful ballad plays. I say soulful because there’s a hammond organ and a piano playing. Yes. A hammond organ. My dream is very specific.

I take Jordan’s hand and I look across at her. I can tell that she is so happy. I tell her how proud I am of her. She smiles back at me and we dance. Her feet work perfectly. In fact, it is only my feet that get in the way. Jordan dances gracefully as though nothing ever happened to her legs. I tell her I think it’s so hard to believe that she was once so sick. I tell her that all I ever wanted was for her to live a normal life. That’s when she cocks her head, stares me straight in the eyes and says, “my life has been so much better than normal.”

In my dream, my eyes are a little wet when she rests her head on my shoulder the way she did when she was such a little thing. We sway to the music until a hand pats me on the shoulder. It is her groom. He asks if he can take over and we exchange niceties. I walk over to Jeanette and resume dancing with her, staring over at the bride and groom. Jordan looks so peaceful; so ready to start a whole new life.

I love it when I have this dream. I sometimes wish for it when I’m falling asleep. Like every story connected to Jordan, it doesn’t have an end. The first time I remember waking from this dream, I couldn’t get the image of Jordan’s smile out of my head for the entire day. It was a great mental image to carry me along. It was accompanied by a warm sense of peace.

I felt a sliver of that peace today after my visit with her at CHLA. She’s slowly coming back to us. Her conversations are more coherent, though she still drifts off into silence now and again. Her smile is more genuine and less the comic book artifice that made Jeanette and I so uncomfortable days ago. The medical team has warned us to prepare for a long haul. There are no easy answers in sight and we’ve been told to expect that Jordan won’t be going home any time soon. We’ve also been advised to expect more bad days. But today I left the hospital feeling less dark; filled with a subversive little emotion called hope.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some keep the Sabbath going to church;<br />
I keep it staying at home,<br />
With a bobolink for a chorister,<br />
And an orchard for a dome.</p>

<p>Some keep the Sabbath in surplice;<br />
I just wear my wings,<br />
And instead of tolling the bell for church,<br />
Our little sexton sings.</p>

<p>God preaches, — a noted clergyman, —<br />
And the sermon is never long;<br />
So instead of getting to heaven at last,<br />
I’m going all along!<br />
&ndash; Song of Service by Emily Dickinson</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Slayer is lounging with me in our living room. KCRW is blasting on the system. We&rsquo;re happy and we&rsquo;re chilling on a drizzly Saturday night. She&rsquo;s hard at work on a list. She makes lists all the time. Lists of things she wants. Lists of things she admires. Lists of letters she doesn&rsquo;t quite understand but finds interesting. Little does she know she&rsquo;s a closet typographer.</p>
<p>At one point, she gets completely frustrated with the capital D she is trying to sketch. She crumples up her paper in disgust. I counsel her. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, honey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ndash;I can&rsquo;t draw a D at all!</p>
<p>&ndash;Yes, you can.</p>
<p>&ndash;You&rsquo;re just saying that to make me feel better.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t. I saw her D. It was just fine. But I was actually glad to hear her say those words. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just saying that to make me feel better.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a dose of self-awareness I haven&rsquo;t heard from her much. I worry sometimes that she&rsquo;s un-attuned to the nuances of speech. Another kid makes a sarcastic comment and she doesn&rsquo;t get it. The protective me wishes she got it so she could say, &ldquo;buzz off!&rdquo; She rarely does. But tonight, she was back in my face and I couldn&rsquo;t have been more pleased. The truth was that I wasn&rsquo;t placating her at all. She drew a good D. But that comment was my cue to work with her.</p>
<p>She drew a series of capital D&rsquo;s. We discussed how to make their curves symmetrical and I taught her how to sketch before hardening her lines. She worked and worked and the next thing I knew she had drawn a perfectly formed D. We high-fived. She was proud. And so was I. </p>
<p>I love it when she does this&ndash;when she perseveres. She&rsquo;s the strongest soul I&rsquo;ve ever met.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jordan is very pleased with the outcome of her latest neuro-oncology appointment &hellip; and so are we. Since she has been off of chemo since April and the latest MRI scans appear to be stable, her doctor suggested that we suspend any further chemotherapy for the time being. It&rsquo;s a welcome extension to an already extended vacation from treatment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While rifling through a bin of old CDs in the garage, I came across my copies of the 25th anniversary collection of Diana Ross and The Supremes. The first thing that came to mind: this is an excellent set for Jordan. She loves music and I&rsquo;m constantly selecting new tunes for her. Both she and her brother have a voracious appetite for music. So, I considered myself quite proud of my discovery. I figured I would surprise her at dinner.</p>
<p>After I transferred everything over to my computer and setup the playlist, I cued up the first track, &ldquo;Love is Here and Now You&rsquo;re Gone&rdquo; just as Jordan was descending the staircase. I imagined I would have to wait 30 seconds or so before she asked, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s this, Dad?&rdquo; That&rsquo;s when I would introduce her to Diana, Mary and Flo. Instead, she started singing along.</p>
<p>&ndash;This is such a great song, Dad.</p>
<p>And then she started rambling along doing her best to make up the words she didn&rsquo;t know. She wagged her head from side to side and narrowed her eyes into a squinty rhapsodic look that revealed just how much she savored the classic Motown sound. </p>
<p>&ndash;You know this song? I asked.</p>
<p>&ndash;Yeah, it&rsquo;s on the CD you made for me.</p>
<p>Next came &ldquo;You Can&rsquo;t Hurry Love&rdquo; and again, she was bopping along.</p>
<p>&ndash;Did I give you this one, too?</p>
<p>&ndash;Silly, Daddy!</p>
<p>It turns out, I had this same great idea about 3 years ago. But no matter, we shimmied and swayed to The Supremes together as a family while we dined on a good risotto and talked about Jordan&rsquo;s birthday celebration this weekend. I have to say this for myself: good call, 3 year past Larry. Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes fits the slayer very well.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>An Old Routine</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ll open with a couple of apologies. First, I apologize because I haven&rsquo;t written in awhile. I could say that we&rsquo;ve been very busy, or that no news is good news. Those statements are both true, but there&rsquo;s another reason why I haven&rsquo;t posted to Jordan&rsquo;s Journey for awhile.</p>

<p>I started writing this blog nine years ago when Jordan was diagnosed with cancer. At the time, it served a functional purpose. She was in the hospital and so many kind people wanted to know what was happening, how she was, her prognosis, our condition&ndash;a littany of information&ndash;that I felt overwhelmed. It was just too much for me to manage multiple phone conversations and it pained me to repeat the story and go through the emotions and processing of it all. So, I started a blog. At first, the posts were dry, informative, and directly related to the release of new news. But then, the writer in me engaged. I had all these emotions pent up inside me. It needed an outlet and when I&rsquo;d write a post the feelings would creep in. Releasing the story I witnessed became therapeutic. I was stronger after I wrote. In fact, writing became the only way to exorcise the restless doubts that haunted my mind. </p>

<p>Of course, I allowed my therapy to be public. Anyone could read what I was thinking and feeling, and in time the blog developed an audience. I&rsquo;m not going to lie. I&rsquo;m a ham. It is a great pleasure to to write. It&rsquo;s an even greater pleasure to know that someone is reading what I write. And it&rsquo;s intoxicating to hear that some of those readers actually enjoy it. That&rsquo;s what happened. And when it happened, my therapy became something else. I started thinking about what I wanted to write and very often I found myself saying, &ldquo;no, you can&rsquo;t write about that because you already wrote something like it a few days ago,&rdquo; or &ldquo;well, this story&rsquo;s a downer and the last story was depressing, so maybe write this one to shed some light for the reader.&rdquo; After awhile, the pressure to write what I thought the reader needed next&ndash;a habit that has been drilled into me as a writer since high school&ndash;closed the outlet that was supposed to inform our friends and family while also giving me a place to talk about what I was going through.</p>

<p>Nine years later, we&rsquo;re all tired. We&rsquo;re exhausted, to be perfectly frank. Make no mistake, we don&rsquo;t waste time moping around, wallowing in our misfortune. Jordan would never stand for that! We carry on quite well. In fact, the last few months have been quite pleasant. While she still has bad days and days that are interrupted by seizures, there are fewer bad days than good. I&rsquo;ve been busy building a business, working on a new book, and spending time with my greatest blessing&ndash;my family. There have been moments when I&rsquo;ve thought, &ldquo;I should write about this on the blog.&rdquo; But I didn&rsquo;t. I decided to be a little selfish. I took a break from the blog, only posting a photo here and there. Don&rsquo;t interpret it negatively. Our family is grateful to everyone who follows our journey with us. We continue to be inspired by the profound sentiment and generosity from all of you. Thank you. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a long way of saying I&rsquo;m sorry for not writing. I&rsquo;m not sure how much I&rsquo;ll write in the near future. I know I&rsquo;ll come back to the Journey because Jordan is still traveling on it and there is so much in her life that deserves to be shared. In short, there&rsquo;s so much to write about. But it has to feel right. And, for the past few months, it hasn&rsquo;t felt right to write about it. So, I didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Now, the second reason I want to apologize is because I think I may have alarmed a few of you with our Facebook updates today. Yes, Jordan was back at CHLA for a lengthy MRI, but it was a scheduled MRI&ndash;meaning that this is the scan she has every 3-4 months. There&rsquo;s not any cause for alarm. It&rsquo;s always a bit of an ordeal because Jordan has to be anesthetized and our nerves are prickly at these moments in time. You see, it is at these junctures that we have the opportunity to look inside Jordan&rsquo;s body to guess at what the beast is up to. It&rsquo;s imperfect. As our doctor reminds us, an MRI is not a microscope. The results are not always very illuminating, which leads to a slightly disatissfying experience because the news is bland and inconclusive. Then, there have been the scans when we discover something alarming. Two years ago, the scans showed us a solid tumor growing in a dangerous area of Jordan&rsquo;s spine. We have come to view the scans as an experience that leads to one of two outcomes: banality or danger.</p>

<p>When I say &ldquo;we,&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t just mean Jeanette and I. Jordan is increasingly anxious around MRIs. This morning, while we were waiting at the hospital for the nurses to hook up her port catheter, Jordan burst out with, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m worried!&rdquo; It came from nowhere. A few seconds earlier she had been joking about Zack and Cody. Then she started fidgeting and made her confession. We were very glad that she felt comfortable enough to voice it. Usually, she buries it and engages, instead, in the most odd behavior. Today, she expressed how she felt. Until that moment, I hadn&rsquo;t been emotional at all. The whole day felt routine up until that moment. Then, I was overcome by emotion. We&rsquo;ve done so many MRIs we&rsquo;ve lost count. Jordan told all the nurses today that she was &ldquo;a pro at this.&rdquo; And she is. But no matter how many times we&rsquo;ve gone through the emotions, there&rsquo;s always that bit of tension. Today, Jordan acknowledged it. </p>

<p>So, I really am sorry if my posts sounded dark. I didn&rsquo;t mean to worry anyone. I posted what was coming through live on my end. Jordan was nervous, and scared, and a little bit edgy. She had every right to be. This will sound strange, but I was so happy that she could express these feelings. She works so hard to be brave. And she is brave. But I think sometimes she tries so hard to be brave that she bottles up what she&rsquo;s feeling, the same way that I started bottling up what I was feeling because I didn&rsquo;t want to write about something that I&rsquo;d felt two days before. Our family excels at &ldquo;putting on the good face.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s routine for us. Today, Jordan broke the routine and I hope she allows herself to do it more. It will only make her stronger, and it will only let her enjoy the wonder of her life more.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>Via Flickr:</em><br /> She wasn&rsquo;t able to go last year because surgery got in the way&ndash;and that really bummed her out. But this year Jordan rejoined her friends at Camp Ronald McDonald for Kids, a great camp that she loves. This is her third trip out and she&rsquo;s been talking about it for months. Today, we bid her farewell for five great days on her own.</p>]]></content:encoded>

She’s been here before.<br />
Nothing life can’t cure, she thinks.<br />
Live it up. Live every day. Live this life, she says.<br />
No matter what the day brings,<br />
Climb back up. Push the nonsense back!<br />
Own a room and breathe life in it when you exhale.<br />
That&rsquo;s her mantra.<br />
She rallies those around her to party when the lights go out.<br />
Her eyes may look tired now and then<br />
But she doesn&rsquo;t rest. Unthinkable!<br />
You can rest when you’re dead.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It dawned on me that we don&rsquo;t have enough moving pictures of Jordan on this site. So, here&rsquo;s a very brief conversation. She was preoccupied with her iPad. But you can see, she&rsquo;s doing pretty well.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am not religious. In fact, I am not even certain I could say I am spiritual. Raised in a church-going family with strong Lutheran and Catholic influences, I have read the bible, served at the altar, and sung in the choir. Yet, I lost interest in religion when Jordan embarked on her journey. That’s not to say I hold anything against my many friends who are strong in their faith. They offer prayers for Jordan and our family and I am always grateful as we accept them. But religion is hollow to me.</p>

<p>That’s why I was intrigued by the song in my head when I awoke this morning. It was an old 19th century hymn that we sang at Mt. Calvary Lutheran: a Protestant anthem nearly always accompanied by the bellowing blasts of a daunting pipe organ.</p>

<p>Guide me O Thou great Redeemer <br />
Pilgrim through this barren land. <br />
I am weak but Thou art mighty <br />
Hold me with thy powerful hand. <br />
Bread of heaven <br />
Feed me now and evermore.</p>

<p>These were the hymns of my childhood, and the music geek in me secretly enjoyed their grandness; their drama. I found comfort in them not because of their message but because of their scale.</p>

<p>Today, our pilgrim begins chemo again. It’s an effort to restart the battle against cancer, who is abiding in her brain with great stealth. Her scans are stable, but her seizures are escalating. So, her team has opted to attack again to see if there is a way to starve the beast. The Slayer is about to return to her craft. She’s sanguine about her call to arms. For the rest of us, there is worry, doubt, restlessness.</p>

<p>Perhaps that is why my brain returned to music and Sunday mornings. I still put my faith in science and a girl with the courage of a lion. I know that she will guide me through this next stage of our journey, however barren it might prove. She is, indeed, “bread of heaven.” Today, I celebrate her with a refrain of hope and the blasts of a pipe organ.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img alt="Jordan's Journey" height="333" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8489/8224374369_36dabc4041.jpg" width="500" /></p>
<p>Today is Giving Tuesday, and I&rsquo;d like to make a plug for the Pablove Shutterbugs program. I started playing with my first camera when I was 12 years old. It was a transformational experience. That&rsquo;s why I am particularly fond of Shutterbugs, a nonprofit program that helps children living with cancer develop their own creative voice through the art of photography. Shutterbugs offers an 8-week intensive program in which children receive a camera, pair with a photographic mentor, and embark on a series of assignments that culminates in a public gallery show. It also hosts half-day workshops and support programs throughout the year.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the power of the program with my own eyes. As many of you know, our Slayer was one of the first participants in the Shutterbugs program. It changed her life. She went from being a kid with cancer to a kid with a camera. I know you are hit up throughout the year with many requests to support worthwhile causes, but please consider making a contribution to this great organization. Even a small gift of $10 can make a difference in another kid&rsquo;s life by helping the Pablove Foundation purchase equipment and supplies that enables a generation of creative survivors find ways to express themselves through the lens.</p>
<p>There are two ways you can help. You can make a donation by visiting our fundraising page <a href="http://stayclassy.org/jordanvincent" target="_blank">here</a> {<a href="http://stayclassy.org/jordanvincent" target="_blank">http://stayclassy.org/jordanvincent</a> }. If you don&rsquo;t wish to give at this time, please consider spreading the word about the program by mentioning it on Facebook or Twitter &hellip; or forward this email on to someone else. You can learn more about the program <a href="http://www.pablove.org/shutterbugs/" target="_blank">here</a> {<a href="http://www.pablove.org/shutterbugs/" target="_blank">http://www.pablove.org/shutterbugs/</a> }.</p>
<p>In celebration of the power of photography, I&rsquo;ll be sharing some photographic memories (like the one above) from Jordan&rsquo;s Journey over the next few weeks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For the better part of it, our Memorial Day weekend was uneventful and relaxing. The Slayer worked her puzzles and passed the time on her iPad. She sampled some of her favorite teas, and lounged in several pairs of pajamas.

The only events this weekend were a handful of seizures and auras. We have become accustomed to these. Most are false alarms. She has “the funny feeling” and we quiz her to decide whether or not to give her medication. In most instances, it is only a feeling. She waits with a furrowed brow for the odd sensation in her stomach to pass, and then she moves on to her next order of business.

But then there are the times…

With age and experience with her seizures she is beginning to know when the real thing is coming. This realization is sad to witness. On Saturday, she told me many times that she was having that funny feeling. But there was something different about the way she told me when the real seizure hit.

–Dad, I’m having the funny feeling

–Do you think you need the med-

–My name is Jordan. My name is Jordan. My name is Jordan.

Then she cried for her mom before repeating her own name again–a way to convince herself that her mind was not about to leave her. But it was. And for the next 5-10 minutes she was completely absent, fighting us to crawl off the couch, pupils widened so much that the blue of her eyes nearly disappeared.

We’ve been told that these experiences are more traumatizing for us than Jordan. When we ask her about them, she never remembers any of it. But it makes me sad to hear how distressed she now becomes in those fleeting seconds before. It’s a terrible thing to hear the fear in the voice of one you love. I wish I could take that away.

Today, she was very mellow. She was alert and able to speak, but just quiet and restful. She napped and stared off into vacant spaces. Though I try not to connect dots that aren’t there, I couldn’t help but think of her about this time last year when she had the bad reaction to her seizure medications. She became a listless zombie who sat with me in the room but wasn’t really there. I wouldn’t go so far as to say that’s what she was like today, but she wasn’t her usual spirited self. So, I find myself a little dark. And when I get dark, I turn to writing.

–

Her life’s a fair ground in autumn.
There are echoes of laughter in its alleys.
Shadows of a chasing child
run fast against its gaming stalls.

In the cool dusky breezes of her mind
live warm ghosts of summer
Rushing with sugar,
delighting in freedom,
Pining for a ride on the ferris wheel.

Her memories are a painted dust
That scatters such you have to breathe in it.
It smells of popcorn and hay
And the soles of skipping shoes.

This fair ground belies its seeming stillness.
Life whispers here where once it roared.
A well of hope rests behind those wide black pupils.
And from the blues a lingering love.]]></content:encoded>

A good friend arranged for an artist to include our family in a series of portraits she hopes to exhibit in a few months. The Slayer was first up, and performed like a pro. This was a fun and interesting way to capture the spirit of our family.]]></content:encoded>

<blockquote>
<p>The power which resides in him is new in nature, and none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he know until he has tried … Let us advance on Chaos and the Dark.</p>
<p><em>—Ralph Waldo Emerson</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Slayer has been active. She&rsquo;s had some rough days. The seizures still get in the way a lot. But she doesn&rsquo;t let them stop her. She brought home a dazzling report card this week. And she&rsquo;s taken to do more things for herself. For example, she asks to do her own laundry and seems to enjoy it (albeit on her terms). I&rsquo;ve noticed that she delights in her own independence, and Jeanette and I do all that we can to let her do more for herself. She does not fear to try, which makes me a very proud papa.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Here and there the beast interrupted, but The Slayer kept going. You&rsquo;d think she&rsquo;d go to bed early. Instead, she&rsquo;s entertaining a group of visitors in our living room. That&rsquo;s my girl.</p>]]></content:encoded>

They were once the most perfect little feet you&rsquo;ve ever seen. She ran, danced, jumped and tippy toed. She can&rsquo;t do those things now, but still I love these feet. They are the feet of a cancer slayer. They give new meaning to the word footprint.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0T2uB-GLc8]

Scientists at Stanford University used an EEG from a patient experiencing a convulsive seizure (like the ones that affect Jordan) to construct an audio recording using tones that fell into the human voice spectrum. The resulting audio track is haunting and reveals a fascinating perspective on what’s happening when the brain is disrupted by the electrical storm we call seizures.

To understand what you’re listening to, here’s an except from the piece in <em>Fast Company</em>:
<blockquote>“Around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0T2uB-GLc8#t=20s" target="_blank">0:20</a>, the patient’s seizure starts in the right hemisphere, and the patient is talking and acting normally. Around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0T2uB-GLc8#t=1m50s" target="_blank">1:50</a>, the left hemisphere starts seizing while the right is in a postictal state. The patient is mute and confused. At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0T2uB-GLc8#t=2m20s" target="_blank">2:20</a> both hemispheres are in the postictal state. Patient is looking around, still confused, trying to pick at things, and get out of bed.”</blockquote>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In <em>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</em>, Robert Persig said, “the only Zen you can find on the tops of mountains is the Zen you bring up there.” It feels like we’ve climbed a lot of mountains on Jordan’s Journey. Sometimes, the task feels downright Sisyphean, but on each new summit I think we’ve discovered a kind of Zen. We keep going on to the next mountain because we can and we must, and the Zen we bring with us comes from two sources: from the Slayer’s seemingly endless spirit, and from the generous hearts of the people around us.

Today tested our Zen. It began with great disappointment, but as I write this I am filled with such humility and deep appreciation for the people in my life that I have struggled to write. I have erased and rewritten the paragraph above a few dozen times, until finally, like the Slayer does on her journey, I decided to move on. She always tells me, “never give up.” So, I’m going to keep going with this post.<!--more--><!-- more -->

Today was the <a title="UTA Million Mile Run Fundraising Page" href="http://www.alexslemonade.org/mypage/116014" target="_blank">UTA Million Mile Run</a> meetup that Jordan and I organized on behalf of <a title="Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation (ALSF)" href="http://alexslemonade.org" target="_blank">Alex’s Lemonade Stand Foundation</a>. When Liz Scott, Alex’s mom and co-founder of ALSF, emailed me and told me that she was planning to launch this inspiring program in September, I immediately committed Jordan and I to the cause. It’s a fantastic idea: people joining together in one month to collectively walk a million miles to show support for all children who are fighting pediatric cancer. Jordan was so inspired that she committed to walk a mile herself. And when I put the word out to my colleagues that we were taking on this challenge, I was overwhelmed by how many of them lined up to walk or run with us. In just two weeks, my UTA family has already raised over $5,000 and logged more than 250 miles. Today, those same colleagues took time out of their Sunday to converge with their families in tow on the park at Page Museum to walk together in solidarity.

Sadly, we were not able to join them. The Slayer had a massive seizure a few minutes before we arrived at the museum. We were having the nicest conversation and then Jordan said those words that we’d love to abolish.

–Mom, I’m having the funny feeling.

Jeanette calmly gave Jordan Ativan, hoping this was just another aura that would subside once the anti-seizure drug got into Jordan’s bloodstream. But within a minute, we knew it was more than an aura. Jordan quickly began reciting her name.

–My name is Jordan. My name is Jordan. My name … Mom! My na-

There is a scream that Jordan has started making before the seizure takes full hold of her. It is a half cry and half panicked plea for help. I would love to never hear this scream again. I always feel so helpless when she sounds it, especially when I’m behind the wheel of a moving car like I was today. That scream breaks my heart.

I turned the car off Wilshire Blvd less than a block from where my colleagues were gathering. Jeanette climbed over the front seat as I looked for a spare curb to pull over. Jordan had left us by now, the fun-loving force of will we know and love had gone wandering elsewhere and left us with a shaking, dilated zombie. But her indomitable spirit showed traces of being present. It animated her body to complete certain tasks with certitude. She kicked off her shoes and she was trying to unfasten her seat belt. Jeanette did everything that she could to restrain Jordan—to keep her from getting out of her seat. It amazes me how strong Jordan can be when she is incapacitated like this. She’s thin as a rail but don’t let that fool you. She has uncommon strength when she calls for it, and in the moving Jeep foraging for parking on Fairfax Ave she had summoned her muscles to work.

When the big ones hit, a lot of Jordan’s body shuts down. She sometimes vomits. Sometimes, she loses control of her bladder and bowels. It was the latter today, and the always-hygienic child we have raised was fighting her mom as she attempted to get out of her soiled clothing. She was still unable to speak. Her vocabulary was only sucking sounds and deep breaths. I knew then, there was no way we would be able to attend the meetup. After finding a spare curb, I texted Laura and René, two of my amazing colleagues at work who organized the day’s event. I regretfully told them we had to go back home.

By the time we reached the freeway, Jordan was beginning to return. She found words again, but they were mostly the same word over and over.

<strong>Jeanette:</strong> What’s your name?

<strong>Jordan:</strong> Jordan

<strong>Jeanette:</strong> What’s your phone number?

<strong>Jordan:</strong> Jordan

<strong>Jeanette:</strong> Who’s driving the car?

<strong>Jordan:</strong> Jordan

Don’t be sad if you’re tempted to laugh at this dialog because Jeanette and I do. Sometimes, you need to laugh at the absurdities shoveled up by the disease. You have to. It’s how you find that Zen state and have the strength to climb another mountain.

Because of Jordan’s accident, I rolled down all the windows in the Jeep. By the time we reached 70 miles an hour, I looked back at the ladies in the rear view mirror. Jordan had put her sunglasses back on. The kid gets point for coolness. No matter what blow cancer throws her, she has dignity and style. The rush of air coming from the windows blew both of my girls’ hair forward. With their shades on and wind-swept do’s the image in the mirror looked like two girls on a fashionable album cover. So I did what I always try to do when things like this happen. I made a joke, hoping to fetch a smile from one or both of them.

–Better and cheaper than Dry Bar

Jordan looked forward stoically. She was still a little out of it. Jeanette, however, laughed out loud. If I did nothing else today, at least I made my wife laugh a little. It may seem a small accomplishment, but I love it when she laughs.

When we got home we rushed Jordan upstairs and into the shower. She took her time, letting the warm water flow over her. She was speaking again but there was a melancholy in her voice. As usual, she did not remember anything leading up to or during the seizure. She was tired. After brushing her still-wet hair she retired to her room to play on her iPad for a bit before falling asleep, which we knew she would. She sleeps long and hard after the big seizures. In fact, she’s still sleeping as I write this.

I felt utterly defeated today. We missed the big event we’d been waiting for all week. I felt the need to do something, so I went out and started walking. By the time I came home, I added 8 miles to our team count. If nothing else, I wanted to walk with my colleagues in spirit. I wanted to walk for Jordan and Alex.

This event meant so much to us. Jordan and I had been practicing her social skills for days. I told her that a lot of people wanted to meet her, and when they introduced themselves she needed to (a) shake their hands and (b) thank them by name. We practiced two scenarios. In one, the person said their name when they introduced themselves. In the other, they didn’t say their name. In the first scenario, I taught Jordan to say “hi” and repeat the person’s name. In the second, I taught her to say “hi” and ask their name. I tried to trip her up with a few crazy names.

<strong>Me</strong> <em>(in character):</em> Hi, Jordan.

<strong>Jordan:</strong> Hi. What’s your name?

<strong>Me:</strong> Wilhelm

<strong>Jordan:</strong> Dad, that’s a silly name.

<strong>Me:</strong> Go with it.

<strong>Jordan:</strong> Hi, Wilhelm. Thanks for coming.

We even did a final round of this exercise this morning as Jordan ate her breakfast. She was ready to go. We’d all packed our cameras. We were wearing our ALSF t-shirts. And we were ready to rally the troops to put more miles on the board for Alex and fellow cancer fighters everywhere.

So, we were quite disappointed when we weren’t able to be a part of what unfolded while we dealt with the latest seizure episode. But what happened in our absence was amazing. It left me full of humility and faith in people. From the reports that streamed over my phone from several friends, a huge crowd turned out to put miles on the board: colleagues and spouses and lots of kids. My friend René sent me this photo of her son Chase. Each mark on his arm is a lap that he completed for Alex and Jordan. I’ve been at this so long it takes a lot to make me emotional, but that picture got me.

Another one of my colleagues sent me this pic earlier in the week. It’s a jar that her twins are using to save their allowance so that they can contribute to ALSF.

<img src="http://media.tumblr.com/53172ddfeb90adbdaf7073add14f0a55/tumblr_inline_mt6q5aUJM61r5aaue.jpg" alt="image" />

Kids contributing to help other kids.

That’s what ALSF is all about. It all began with Alex, who setup her very first lemonade stand with a selfless purpose. She wasn’t raising money to fight her own cancer. She was raising money to end cancer for all children. And she kept on doing that until she raised a million dollars on her own before the disease cut short her crusade. We lost a great cancer fighter when Alex passed away, but the greatest tribute to her is the growth of the cause she inspired and led. The spirit behind that cause was alive and thriving at the Park at the Page Museum this morning. Though the Slayer was not able to be part of that effort, we are so proud of our friends and colleagues who came out to show their support. Our family is grateful to them all, and to all of you who read along and support us day in and day out as we keep climbing mountains, led by a girl who knows how to do one thing extraordinarily well: to keep going.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[September is National Childhood Cancer Awareness month and our friends at Alex’s Lemonade Stand Foundation have launched a really inspiring initiative called the <a title="Million Mile Run" href="http://millionmilerun.org" target="_blank">Million Mile Run</a>. People from all over are running/walking a million miles collectively to stand with cancer fighters and show their support for the cause. My colleagues at UTA have taken my breath away by lining up to join us. It inspired our family so much that Jordan pledged to walk a mile, too. Tonight, she got closer to her goal. I came home early and we went around the block together—a full 1/3 of a mile!

It was a lovely evening in Santa Monica, with a nice cool breeze and sunny skies. We chatted about the day’s events and funny things Jordan found on Pinterest as we lumbered around our neighborhood. I held her hand while supporting her with her gait belt. Halfway through our walk we reached an alley that could have served as a nice shortcut. I asked if she wanted to take the easier route.

—No, dad. Let’s keep walking.

And we did.

That girl goes out of her way to find new ways to inspire me. I can’t think of a better reason to leave work early.

Won’t you join us? Sign up to walk with us, or pledge your support by making a contribution to ALSF in Jordan’s honor. Our fundraising page can be found <a title="Jordan's Team Fundraising Page" href="http://www.alexslemonade.org/mypage/116014" target="_blank">right here</a>. If you don’t know about Alex’s Lemonade Stand Foundation, take a minute to <a title="About Alex" href="http://www.alexslemonade.org/about/meet-alex" target="_blank">read the inspiring story of Alexandra Scott</a>, who raised more than $1 million to fund cancer research before losing her own battle with the disease. Today, ALSF has raised more than $60 million towards fulfilling Alex’s mission of ending cancer for all children. Just a few months ago they wrote $7 million in grants for promising research. When you learn about all that they’re doing, you’ll understand why the Slayer is proud to be a <a title="Jordan's Hero Ambassador Page" href="http://www.alexslemonade.org/hero/jordan-marin-vincent" target="_blank">Hero Ambassador</a> for this wonderful organization.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Slayer has more guys than just me wrapped around her little finger. She has a fondness for Brooks Ketchup. You can only find it east of the Mississippi, in places like Galesburg, Il, where my Uncle Pat lives. Whenever she runs out of her favorite condiment, he ships her a new batch. If you want to see Jordan light up with delight, watch her face when she opens a box of Brooks from her loyal admirer in the Land of Lincoln.]]></content:encoded>

I stopped sleeping on my own about seven years ago. This confession makes me squirm. I feel a shame in it, like I’m some kind of addict coming out to the world. I became an insomniac during a particularly difficult step in Jordan’s Journey; during some of the worst regimens of chemotherapy and frequent hospitalizations. It was so long ago, it’s hard for me to remember how small she was back then. She was only seven. She still had the same fierce will of the warrior we know and love.<!--more-->

I’ve always been a light sleeper. I can only remember one period of time, when I was about Luc’s age, that I could sleep for hours and hours without interruption. Other than that time, the slightest sound wakes me. Ordinarily, my fragile sleep state wasn’t a problem because I could always fall back asleep. But during that horrible year in 2006, I couldn’t go back to sleep. Sometimes I couldn’t fall asleep at all. After lying in bed wide awake for a long enough period of time, I’d wander the house and get things done. People thought I was crazy when they got emails from me at 3am. Little did they know it was not by choice.

I suppose it was understandable when my doctor insisted that I let him prescribe a sleep aid. Jordan had recently experienced a seizure so severe that she was nearly ventilated. That was the first time anyone ever asked Jeanette or I if we wanted to sign a DNR (do not resuscitate) order. Of course, we declined. But the question lingered. I can’t say that the question kept me awake at night. But something did. From that day forward, when I wanted to sleep, I took the pill prescribed to me. This went on for years until this summer when I decided enough was enough. I hate pills. I hate being dependent on anything or anyone to live a normal life. So, I stopped taking my prescription in June and, after several sleepless nights, discovered what I was missing for seven years: dreams.<!-- more -->

We all dream. Every night. We might not recall what we dream, but our minds do it effortlessly and habitually. I can’t really claim that I haven’t dreamed for 7 years, but when taking sleep medication I seldom awoke with any recollection of my dreams. That has changed. It’s wonderful. While I’ve certainly experienced some nail-biting thrillers, I have also enjoyed saturated adventures and nostalgic epics with my family. I’ve refamiliarized myself with that wonderful feeling when you wake up and your emotions are still in the dream state—bubbling, moved, enlightened. These are the feelings that stick with you through your breakfast, follow you into the shower, and linger around during the morning commute. I suppose most of us take them for granted. After 7 years of absence, I find them delightful.

This morning, I awoke from one of those dreams. It was a Labor Day dream. It was a dream of an experience that never happened, and yet it felt so authentic. It felt so natural. It felt so much a part of my conscience I had to ask if it wasn’t somehow part of my family history.

The dream was a postcard to the end of summer. Jeanette and Jordan and Luc and I were at the beach. To see the way we were dressed in my dream you would have imagined that Ralph Lauren was a close family friend. We wore rolled up denim and white cotton shirts. We walked barefoot on a shore that wasn’t quite on Santa Monica bay, but it did feel very much like a place we’d been many times. The kids quarreled a little as they disrobed into their swimsuits. We taunted one another with jokes. We laid down blankets on the sand. In my dream, I felt the heat of the sun on my skin. I felt the absence of care. It was the slowest moving dream I can remember, and yet the emotions connected to it were overpowering. My girl, The Slayer, was perfectly normal. I know that word ‘normal’ is a misnomer that we are often cautioned to avoid, but let me explain what I mean. In my dream, Jordan’s feet were perfect. She ran and jumped and flicked sand with her toes. Her speech was also perfect. She argued about books that she read. Books! She read one right there on the sand. At one point in my dream, I remember Jordan having friends that joined us for awhile. Friends. Girls who gossiped with her and giggled about the travails of middle school life.

She was a perfectly ordinary teenage girl, no less beautiful than she is today, and not the least bit impaired in any way.

It’s a silly dream, I suppose. Perhaps it was my over-sentimental imagination. Perhaps, it was in response to the night before, when I sat with Jordan and Jeanette on the floor of her hospital room piecing a puzzle together. Jordan’s head was wrapped in gauze so that she wouldn’t accidentally dislodge the electrodes that are glued to her scalp. Here and there she complained about how itchy it was, but Jeanette and I were usually able to distract her. She was sanguine but quiet. Earlier in the day she experienced her first real seizure since being admitted. It lasted for several minutes and left her tired and bereft of much to say. For the tests to be truly useful, we need a few more of these seizures to come on while she’s wired. It’s the one time we oddly find ourselves hoping for a “good one.”

It’s scary, too. To facilitate the process, the medical team has weaned Jordan off of all her medication. She’s living without a net. Granted, she’s in the safest possible environment, with round-the-clock medical attention and her every move observed by computers and cameras. Still, I can’t help but think back to when the seizures took her away from us for a week … when she didn’t seem to know I was there … when they asked me if I wanted them to resuscitate her should she stop breathing.

I’ve been awake for three hours and I still can’t shake my beautiful dream. I can still see Jordan on that beach, drenched in orange sunlight, attracting boys’ attention, irritating her brother, exasperating her mother, and running off into the water when she felt the need to escape her parents. It’s a life we might have had. Sometimes, that feeling makes me angry. Sometimes, it makes me hopeful. I wouldn’t trade a day with The Slayer for anything. Despite the traumas and the setbacks, she is a family blessing, just like her brother. Our journey has been unique, and I remind myself how wonderful it has been to travel it with these beautiful souls I call my family. How much we have learned to lean on one another. How much The Slayer has taught me about life. How much I can feel the warmth of the sun when she smiles at me and asks to start another puzzle.

Still, I sometimes dream of the end of summer, and the perfectly ordinary life that could have been.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Slayer checked in to Childrens Hospital Orange County (CHOC) this morning for at least a week of tests. This was a scheduled visit. She’s working with the neurology team there to do some extensive observation of her seizures. They’ve been coming on much more frequently. As you know, we’ve tried many drug therapies. With some, she’s experienced such severe reactions that they’ve been ruled out entirely, narrowing our options. With this stay, we’re hoping to gather new data that can help the neurology team develop therapeutic options.

Jordan has been very cooperative and positive about the stay. She hates the process. It’s not painful, but it does require her to wear electrodes on her head 24/7. They get itchy and make her uncomfortable.

She’ll be at CHOC for at least a week. Unlike past visits, they won’t send her home until they get the data. The last time we did this series of tests, Jordan had no seizures at all during her week of observation. This time around, if the seizures don’t occur, the doctors will begin weaning her off of her seizure medications–in other words, they’ll put her in a state that is likely to induce a seizure in a controlled environment. For this reason, she could be inpatient for quite some time.

I thought I would send you some photos from her admission this morning. You can see what it’s like when she becomes a human antenna.

<strong>Photos</strong>

As usual, The Slayer was a pro’s pro with the process. She was talkative and friendly all throughout the check-in process.

Waiting is always the hardest part for her. She gets bored easily like any other teenager. Time can make long, observational tests like this one the biggest challenge.

She’s got a room to herself with a fairly decent view. Her only roommate is her mom, who has to be with her at all times to help in the monitoring process.

When it was time to begin, Jordan relaxed in a pair of her favorite pajamas and watched television calmly. At one point, she had a mild seizure, but it was before she was wired so we can’t count it towards our data quota.

By the time she’s wired, she looks like something between a mummy and a sock puppet. I kept teasing her about it. Somehow she tolerates from me words that would be gasoline from her brother or just about anyone else.

You can see the video of her being monitored in the background. When I left, she was enjoying TV (even though it looks like she’s frowning). The equipment at CHOC is top rate. Unlike previous stays, she can get out of bed and stay active because the devices are very portable. That little blue pack to her right holds the controller and it straps on when she gets up.

		<title>An MRI Day in the Life of The Slayer</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was that time again–the time we&rsquo;ve become accustomed to every 3 months. Jordan went in her for her quarterly MRI scans. It was a good day and her scans were stable; no new growth as far as we can tell.</p>
<p>The picture above captures the essence of MRI day. It&rsquo;s a lot of waiting, so we all bring devices to keep ourselves occupied. Just a few minutes after this photo was caught, however, Jordan had a very large seizure in the waiting room. It was of the variety that she can feel coming on, causing her so much anxiety and anguish that it&rsquo;s truly heartbreaking for us to watch. Today, she even let out a feeble scream seconds before her face contorted and her eyes went vacant. She was fine enough soon, but ready to rest. Good thing she would be taking a 2.5 hour propofol-induced nap while the MRI recorded the status of her brain.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/8b6430ecf6b11964d8ae732be268ba85/tumblr_inline_mpr2t1uFFm1qz4rgp.jpg" /></p>

<p>Even after bouncing back from a seizure, Jordan reminded us that she&rsquo;s a pro at the pre-op process. I can&rsquo;t help but think back to 10 years ago when she was so much younger and much less cooperative. Getting her accessed was a chore. She often had to be physically restrained as the nurses attempted to give her the IV. Today, she impresses them all with her calmness and her gentility. Some of the nurses call her &ldquo;the champion.&rdquo; She likes that. A lot.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/e5171b7c29a8e8d6a8fa2356cfdb1025/tumblr_inline_mpr2w2RWel1qz4rgp.jpg" /></p>
<p>It usually takes Jordan quite awhile to wake up after the extended period of time she&rsquo;s anesthetized. We found her sleeping peacefully in post-op, but she surprised us today by waking up pretty quickly and with little fuss.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/bb0ad64c24283cc458b610b3bafb0f32/tumblr_inline_mpr2y5HXEA1qz4rgp.jpg" /></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever properly introduced you to Delilah. Delilah is Jordan&rsquo;s sleep buddy. She is even allowed to sleep in the MRI with Jordan. I lay her down next to The Slayer before I give her a pre-sedation kiss. Delilah is a hero, too.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/b33ad773feaf770d1e64d5c3e2b1568d/tumblr_inline_mpr313EzTE1qz4rgp.jpg" /></p>
<p>After the procedure, there&rsquo;s a lot more waiting. We wait for Jordan to wake up and be alert enough to drink some fluids. Then we wait for her to go through triage at the clinic. And finally, we wait to meet with the oncology team to hear the test results. Those iPads get a lot of use during all the waits.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/27a90eaa1b21f50b8bbad586b3fb0c93/tumblr_inline_mpr32wb6ny1qz4rgp.jpg" /> </p>
<p>Though her eyes may look a little sorrowful in this picture, she was actually in very good spirits. She was hungry and tired. But she waited patiently and allowed me to photograph her while we prepared to finish up and go home.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It has been nearly three years since Jordan last endured chemotherapy. And we are very grateful to be done with weekly trips to the clinic, watching Jordan’s blood counts, and comforting her when the medicine knocked her out or made her sick.

We started 2015 as our third year of “stability.” There is still a tumor in there, but it is stable, meaning that though it is hard to tell if it is active, it is certainly not growing rapidly and it poses less of a threat to Jordan’s health.

But in many ways these past three years have been very difficult for all of us. I was tempted to title this article “aftermath” in reference to the journey that happens after the battle with cancer. But in our case, we’re not really certain the battle with cancer is over. It’s an interregnum. Perhaps a better way to think of this journey is that we’ve turned off the main drag and strolled down some alleys. Some of them dark, others merely curious.<!--more-->

We spend most of our time wandering down three specific alleys. The first, I have written about extensively: seizures. On a typical day, Jordan has 2-3 auras (strong feelings that a seizure is about to happen that can make her nauseous, numb and nervous). She has a full seizure about once a week, sometimes more when her hormones are in flux.

The alley that troubles us most is the one that concerns her weight. She is far too thin. We believe it is a consequence of the tumors. She loves to eat but the problem is that she does not eat enough. This is actually a somewhat common occurrence amongst brain tumor patients. The tumor can cause damage to the area of the brain that controls our satiety. Basically, it loses the ability to tell the body “I’m hungry” and instead sends the signal out that “I’m full.” We’ve put Jordan on the highest calorie diet you can imagine. She drinks shakes all day long. She enjoys a good steak whenever she wants it. But she’s not consuming enough calories to make much of a difference. It’s very troubling to see her so frail. And, of course, the absence of body fat makes it impossible for her legs to get stronger and add muscle tissue.

That leads to the other alley: the legs. Most of the wounds on her feet have closed. There is one that is rather pesky. Her orthopedic surgeon wanted to resculpt her feet to accommodate but we were not keen on subjecting her to another painful bone surgery. We were relieved when our second opinion told us that the procedure would only “address a peripheral symptom of a central problem.” In other words, reshaping her feet will not address the fact that her brain has trouble operating her feet. She balances all of her weight on one bone in her foot. Her brain can’t really control the nerve endings in the foot that you and I take for granted–the ones that cause us to make subtle movements that balance our weight across a complex network of bones and tissue. Reshaping the foot would just shift the weight to another single bone. So, we’ve decided not to do surgery. As a result, Jordan crawls a lot and she spends much more time in her wheelchair than she did in the past.

Sometimes she gets blue and laments the things that she cannot do. But most of the time she goes about with her life. She goes to school when she feels up to it. And we try to get her out and about so life doesn’t seem so closed in.

Truthfully, she’s not the only one that gets blue. These past three years have weighed on all of us. Sometimes, I think we don’t realize how depressed we are. We live with it in such a chronic way that it doesn’t feel like depression. It just feels like life. And, truthfully, we aren’t a sad lot. We laugh and we live, but we also go to bed every night with unsettled thoughts and feelings.

Jordan is 16. She’ll be 17 in August. It is so hard to believe that she is nearing legal adulthood. I often worry about her life as an adult. What will she be able to do on her own? Will she have adequate access to care? Will she one day develop lasting friendships and relationships with others outside her family?

With her body weight so low, what happens if we have to hop back on to the main thoroughfare of cancer fighting? She has no reserves (although, she is still a feisty fighter with an amazing amount of emotional and physical strength).

So many worries, but still so much faith in the slayer. Whenever we hit a dark alley, she usually helps us navigate our way out. And that’s what keeps us going.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The great bandleader Guy Lombardo once said, “many a man wishes he were strong enough to tear a telephone book in half–especially if he has a teenage daughter.” That is an apt way to describe my experience yesterday with The Slayer. <!--more--><!-- more -->

Before I begin, let me state my intent for sharing this particular episode with you. I made a promise to myself long ago that this blog would respect certain boundaries in our family life. My wife and my children have a right to privacy. Just because I experience something with them doesn’t give me the right to share it with the world. Jeanette and I have always been comfortable sharing details about Jordan’s journey with cancer–even details that leave us sometimes feeling vulnerable and afraid. But, I am very careful not to share aspects of our family life that are irrelevant and perhaps embarrassing. It’s not a reality television program.

For example, you’ll note that I rarely write about Luc. It’s not because I don’t care about him, it’s because I respect his privacy. His relationship to me, his sister, and the journey are unique and personal. So, I always ask him before I write about him. The same is true with respect to Jeanette and our marriage. These are topics that don’t belong in the blog without the consent of the people in the family they affect. I also try to respect certain boundaries when reporting about Jordan. She’s very comfortable with (and proud of) this blog. She tells people to visit it! And she doesn’t hide much of her life with strangers. But, out of respect, I sometimes pause and think about whether I have the right to write what I’ve experienced in our journey together or not. Sometimes, I discuss it with Jordan. Sometimes, not. She doesn’t really understand the ramifications of what’s posted, so it is usually me debating with my conscience.

I write all this because I wrestled with my conscience for a bit on whether or not to write this particular episode. In some ways, what I’m about to share is not the least bit unusual for any father with a teenage daughter. Teenage daughters are known to be <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">occasionally</span> frequently petulant. So, in that respect, sharing the details of an episode in obnoxiousness crosses a line. It could be interpreted as a parent airing dirty laundry. We’ve all seen this before on Facebook–the friend or family member who is a parent and opts to scold/shame their child publicly with an angry post. But that’s not really what this is. Instead, I am going to share a day with you that struck me late last night as a great illustration of the complexities of Jordan’s Journey. It has never been simple. Now, with the hormonal rushes and flows of teen-dom (she’ll be 16 next week!), it’s even less simple.

It began with a manicure for three. We started going out for manicures together a few years ago. I have no shame in confessing that I enjoy them. It’s quality time with Jordan and Jeanette. We talk and laugh, and the ladies at the manicure shop get a kick out of having me there. I’m usually the only man. I get spoiled rotten, which makes me the most profitable beneficiary of the experience.

Jordan loves the manicure experience. It turns all of her girly dials to 11. She nearly exhausts herself chatting up the manicurist. The woman who served her yesterday turned to us at the end and said, “I love her! I could chat with her all day.” As she said this, I looked over at Jordan who was on her feet swaying her hips to a pop song she knows that was playing on the salon’s sound system. That’s my girl! Sporting newly lacquered purple nails, she smiled at me and encouraged me to stand and dance with her.

We had such a great time that we all agreed to keep going. Lunch was in order, and after lingering in the usual litany of “what do you want to eat? I don’t know, what do you want to eat?” babble, we settled on a restaurant we like that’s close to the waterfront in Santa Monica.

The first evidence that our social Saturday expedition might encounter some temperamental seas came within seconds of our arrival at the restaurant. In an effort to hasten the drying of her nails, Jordan had been blowing on them in her sassy fashion of twisting her wrist in front of her mouth. She must have misjudged one of those twists because there was a perfect purple line etched across her bottom lip. Jeanette wanted to clean it.

–It’s fine, mom!

–No. It’s not. You need to clean off your lip.

–Mom, just let it go.

Now, this is the point where Nettie generally goes in one of two directions. She either explodes and sets Jordan straight with some stern talk, or she bites her tongue and waits to see if the situation will resolve itself. She employed the latter strategy, and remained quiet for a minute. Let’s just say that Jordan doesn’t know the maxim of letting a sleeping dog lie.

–Mom, can’t I just have a nice day with my family? You need to just let it go. It’s my body and I get to decide what I want to do with it.

Straw, meet camel’s back.

While I secured a table, the ladies had a talk in the washroom and when she came back, most of the purple nail polish had disappeared from Jordan’s lip. Our day was back on track. Wine was in order. Food was on its way. And, then…

Midway into our lunch, Jordan began one of her sales pitches. Here’s how it works. There’s something she really wants. It can be so simple, like she wants me to download a game for her on her iPad. No big deal. But she often times these pitches poorly, like when we’re in the middle of a nice lunch. I told her we could talk about when we got home. But, part of the reason why Jordan has excelled in her battle with disease is her perseverance. When she has something on her mind she tends to stick with it relentlessly. If she were in sales, she would probably win the set of steak knives every month.

–So, when we get home, then you’ll look at it, Dad

–Yes

–Right away? Like what time?

–Jordan, not now. I’ll help you, but not now. I’m eating my lunch.

–But you will do it as soon as we get home?

Jeanette intervened. She likes to fight my battles for me. I’m not so keen on that approach because it generally throws kerosine on the fire rather than extinguishing it. And, that’s exactly what happened. One “butt out, Mom” from Jordan and we had a full-blown bonfire going. As I tried to extinguish it, I noticed that Jordan had a red line running up the side of her cheek. She’d been dipping her grilled cheese into her tomato soup and she somehow used the wedge of toasted bread as a rouge applicator.

–Jordan, you have soup on your cheek.

Pause for a flashback.

When my sister Kelly was a teenager, my father gave me some unsolicited advice. Though he did not live with us, because my parents were divorced, he knew enough to advise me not to intervene or interrupt when my mother and my sister quarreled. “You can’t win,” he said. “It’s like a law of physics. All that energy will then be directed at you.” The old man may have had his faults, but he sure was wise. I discovered just how wise sitting across from the newly-formed hurricane Jordan.

I don’t even remember what was said leading up to it–nothing significant, for sure–but within a minute she hit me with a guilt trip.

–You won’t even let me ride that bicycle.

The backstory: Five years ago, we bought Jordan a bike. It’s a handsome pink beach cruiser. Back then, she was making progress with her legs and her physical therapist used a stationary bike at the gym. Jordan loved it. We thought a real bike would be a good incentive to work harder.

She wants so bad to ride that bike without training wheels. The problem is threefold: she has no balance, her feet still have open wounds and her legs are the size of matchsticks. We’ve explained to her many times that it is not safe for her to try and train on that bike right now. It’s a good long-term goal, but it isn’t obtainable at this moment in time.

I am well aware of the reality check. Every teenager utilizes a guilt trip at some point in time. What Jordan did is not the least bit out of the ordinary. But, where she digs for the guilt is what makes it tricky. She retreats to setbacks in her treatment, her body’s limitations, and facts of life with cancer that we neither caused nor can control.

The bike comment stung. In part, it stung because it had nothing to do with our conversation. It came from nowhere, like a gremlin that’s been hiding under a box in the garage right next to the dusty bike. It stung more than most barbs because the fact that I can’t let her ride that bike makes me very sad. I looked around that restaurant, which is in a very luxurious hotel, and saw so many kids running, doing cartwheels, dancing, moving however they felt; and I wished that Jordan hadn’t walked in hobbling on feet that betray her. I wished that we didn’t have to hold her gait belt to keep her from falling. I wish we didn’t have to choose a restaurant that required limited walking because we forgot to pack the wheelchair. There is nothing more that I would enjoy than seeing Jordan pedal away from me on a beach cruiser. It would be awesome for a girl who wants independence. We’ve all felt the exhilarating rush of stomping down on a pedal and accelerating from your own power on two wheels. I want Jordan to feel that rush. I can’t give it to her now.

I told Jordan that she was out of line. I told her how much I want her to ride that bike. And I told her that her comment was rude and offensive. She tried to make me feel bad about something that had nothing to do with our discussion. And she did this after I’d been trying to help us have a nice day doing things she liked.

Jordan backed her chair away from the table, stood up as best she could, and wandered over to a couch where she sat until we were ready to go. She didn’t speak to me for about an hour.

And that’s where our story pivots. Our Act III resolves in a way you might not have expected. After the mostly silent trip home, and the three of us dispersing within the house, Jeanette reminded me that I had promised Jordan Saturday would be an 80’s movie night. Every weekend, Jordan and I watch a movie from the 1980’s. It was a crazy idea I had awhile back when I realized how much I loved the movies of my teenage years, and how much I wanted to share them with my kids. Luc wasn’t interested, but Jordan was totally game. Ever since, we’ve immersed ourselves in the great greats (at least in my book) from 1980-1989. Sometimes, we watch a double-feature. And, on some weekends we’ve binged every night.

Earlier in the day, I’d given Jordan three choices for our feature (all unseen to date): <em>Top Gun</em>, <em>Amadeus</em>, or <em>National Lampoon’s Vacation</em>. When I give her a choice, I try to break into action, drama, comedy. She wanted to laugh, so <em>Vacation</em> it was. I had also promised that I would bring her bean bag chair down to the living room so she could watch the movie on it.

When it was time for the screening, she lumbered down the stairs, only barely making eye contact with me. I smiled. We made a little small talk. Jeanette popped some pop corn. Jordan plopped into the bean bag chair. And then … we laughed. We laughed a lot. She enjoyed the movie so much that we decided to keep on laughing; we queued up <em>Planes, Trains and Automobiles</em>.

When the last credit rolled, we cleaned up the living room together and made our way up to bed. Before I tucked her in, she gave me a giant hug and apologized for snapping at me. I told her I understood. I also told her I hoped she would ride that bike one day.

We ended our day as it began; each our biggest fan.

Like any other teenager, Jordan can be a jerk. And when she conjures her inner brat, it’s our job as parents to call her out on it. Just as I have respected the boundaries of what’s suitable to post and not post on her journey, Jordan needs to learn the boundaries of playing the cancer card.

I know there will be more outbursts. More guilt trips and tantrums. More bikes to store. More grooming arguments. There will be more hurt feelings and more resentment. More miscommunication and more talking past each other. I’ll take the “mores” gladly. Because that’s the price tag that comes with the fight. We’ve been on a mission for mores. As upsetting as they can be, these mores also bring us closer to a normal life. And as long as they are counterbalanced by more manicures, more lunches. More movie nights. More laughter and hugs and wonderful time being absorbed by all that makes us more imperfectly wonderful, I think we’re all game for the ride.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It may have been one of the best turkey burgers I’ve ever had. Or, maybe it was the company and the conversation that affected my impression of this fried culinary masterpiece. I sat across from a friend of many years–a friend who I sadly don’t make a point to visit nearly enough. He is a creative mentor, an innovative entrepreneur who always manages to weave his creative pursuits into inspiring social causes, and a long-time supporter of our Slayer. They are connected in more ways than one. He, too has wrestled with cancer, and as a result he has always been there when we’ve been in the thick of the fight. He is my friend Roger Holzberg.<!--more-->

Our conversation danced between our latest professional endeavors and the adventures of our families, all the while punctuated by the delicacy of my abundant supply of french fries (which Roger helped me finish). Midway through he asked the question we return to every time we chat: how is Jordan?<!-- more -->

I rattled off my stock reply. The cancer appears to be stable. We don’t know if it’s gone, but it’s not growing, and it’s hard to tell if it is shrinking. She has been away from chemo for about two years. Our biggest issues now are the swarm of seizures and auras she encounters every day; her ongoing mobility issues; and, her precarious weight (she’s so thin she doesn’t even register on the charts doctors use to evaluate a girl her age). As usual, I bundled this information into an optimistic outlook–a “things are good” tone.

That’s when Roger asked me about my writing. In a way only a true mentor can, he delicately asked why the posts to this blog went quiet.

I’ve thought about this many times. I started this year with a pledge to restart the blog, even to make Jordan more of a participant. But I have been reluctant to write about our life. I think a lot of it has to do with business. But frankly, that’s somewhat of a crutch. I could find time to write. I’ve <em>chosen</em> not to write about Jordan’s Journey. If I’m truly honest with myself and with you, I haven’t wanted to write because so much of what we encounter every day is the same. There doesn’t feel like there has been any progress. And there are many reasons why we feel a little deflated.

A year ago, in an effort to improve the strength of Jordan’s legs, and to increase her mobility, her doctors wrapped her feet in plaster casts. These casts were designed to “reset” the position of her feet and stretch her muscles and tendons. The casts worked … sort of. When they were removed weeks later, her feet were indeed better positioned to support her weight. But, the casts caused troublesome blood blisters. When they burst, she had open wounds that refused to heal. These wounds were not infected, but they wouldn’t close–mostly because she uses her feet a lot. For the last year she has worked with a wound specialist to encourage healing, and Jeanette re-dresses her bandages several times a day. But Jordan’s feet have stubbornly refused to heal (why Jordan refers to them as “trouble feet”). Now, we’re gearing up for another surgery. A plastic surgeon will attempt to close the wounds for good. When that’s done, we’ll redouble her physical therapy program. In the meantime, she has a new wheelchair that makes it easier for her to get around on her own. And, her knees are heavily bruised and scabbed from all the time she spends crawling around the house. I have to hand it to her, she doesn’t sit still.

Meanwhile, the seizures swarm about her and shake everyone’s confidence. If she has the slightest stirring in her abdomen she is instantly on-guard. Sometimes it’s nothing more than “the funny feeling,” which subsides after medicine–sometimes on its own. But other times it progresses and takes her out completely.

Last night, in the span of only a few hours, she had five seizure episodes, the last very close to “the real thing.” When they cluster like that it drains everyone’s morale. I ended my evening feeling very down.

And when I say that the seizures have evolved, what I mean is that they manifest in new and unusual ways. In the past week, Jordan has been plagued by a new phenomenon that inhibits her ability to speak. In fact, it seems to take over her speech. While looking at us she utters repetitive gibberish. Last night, it was “ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma…” What is most peculiar about these new brain surges is that Jordan is aware of what’s happening the whole time. She is conscious of her odd speech, and unlike all the other seizures, she remembers every moment.

In a few short weeks, Jordan will turn 16. I suppose it is unsurprising that she longs to do things on her own. In fact, she has expressed to us a strong desire for more independence. Sometimes that yearning even manifests as resentment toward her brother, whom she observes going out with friends and having the freedom to wander without supervision. For awhile, this resentment led to some pretty strong outbursts towards him. But lately she has been dealing with these feelings in a very mature way. In fact, she told us that she knows it is not Luc’s fault that he can go out and be a teenager while she must constantly stay close to her parents. And she has tried harder to be kind to him. I am very proud of her for that. But I feel sad when she the differences make her sad, and when she gets melancholy it is usually because she feels like a shut-in.

This afternoon she wanted to come with me to grab a bite to eat. Still a bit shaken from all the seizure activity last night, I told her that I didn’t think it was a good idea. Jeanette had already eaten and Jordan really wanted to have daddy/daughter time, but I was fearful of how to handle a big seizure in public without assistance. I was candid about this with J, and she said she understood as she patted my shoulder. I immediately regretted my decision. I felt like a coward.

Still, you can’t beat the girl on positive mental attitude. Her world has a predominantly sunny disposition, and we are encouraging her to do more and more on her own. She went to camp again this summer–always the highlight of her year. And for her birthday she is traveling up to Portland to celebrate with our extended family. She wanted to go alone, but the airlines are not very accommodating of people with seizure disorders. We were told that if she had a seizure in-flight they would not administer medication and they would be forced to make an emergency landing. So, Jordan reluctantly agreed to have her mother accompany her. She’s still looking forward to the trip.

I shared many of these feelings with Roger that day at lunch. And that’s when he inspired me, and probably permanently altered my perception of the flavor of that delicious turkey burger. Roger encouraged me to start blogging about Jordan again, even if I kept the posts private. He reminded me that this blog serves as more than a way to keep people updated about Jordan’s status. And, it’s more than a writer’s way to dump his feelings. It’s a record. It’s a way to look back and follow a journey. Roger made me realize that everything we’ve shared here helps us understand the progress and the regressions, the triumphs and the setbacks, the joys and the heartaches. My dear friend reminded me that I am not writing this blog for me, but for Jordan.

I have always dreamed that one day Jordan could take over for me; that she could blog about her life and tell her story in her own way. I don’t know if that will ever happen, but until it does I will find a way to keep posting. After my lunch with Roger, I went back and skimmed through the many posts in this blog. I relived so many of our experiences and actually felt a great sense of hope. Because through it all there have been two constants: the resilience of “the girl” and the encouragement of so many beautiful friends.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Our Wish for 2014</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With only a few exceptions, I took a year off of <em>Jordan’s Journey</em> in 2013. 10 years ago to this very day, my 5 year-old daughter started having excruciating headaches. As you probably know, kids don’t get headaches often. That’s why we found it odd that Jordan kept complaining about her head hurting. She did this through the holidays, but then she’d sleep it off and bounce back to the fun and spirit of the season. But on January 30, 2003, something was different. She was in so much pain. In a matter of days she would be in the hospital, about to have several surgical procedures, and she would begin her journey as a cancer slayer.

Those memories are still fresh in my mind after all these years. Even though Jordan’s cancer is currently stable, our family’s “threat level” is always elevated to orange. We find plenty of ways to have fun and to enjoy each day, but there is a shadow that follows us everywhere. We try to ignore it. We reason it’s harmless–the product of anxiety and trauma–but we never take our eye off of it.<!--more-->

This is why I wrote about the journey less in 2013. I didn’t want to give any strength to the shadow. I wanted to let it sit there on its own for awhile. I wanted to give space for my daughter to live as normal of a life as she possibly could. I wanted to take the pressure off of my son, who has often sacrificed parts of his own childhood to walk with his family on this journey. And, frankly, I wanted time away myself. I didn’t want to write about cancer or slaying cancer or the emotions that accompany both.

My off year is closing and I will pick up on the journey anew in 2014. I hope that Jordan will help me more, to tell the story her way. In January, she has a book coming out that <a title="Red Fred Project" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2069622302/the-red-fred-project-50-books-by-50-critically-ill" target="_blank">she co-authored with our good friend Dallas Graham for the Red Fred Project</a>. It’s going to be fantastic! We are also planning to bring back our podcast series. And we have photo projects in the works. You’ll find them all here throughout the year.

But before we close 2013, I’d like to ask you to help us achieve a goal that is very meaningful to Jordan and our entire family. You’ve heard us speak often about our favorite charities. Jordan is proud of her work with The Pablove Foundation and Alex’s Lemonade Stand Foundation. This year, Alex’s Lemonade dedicated their winter fundraising drive to Jordan’s honor. They made a movie about her journey (seen below) and they’ve set a goal to raise $40,000 which will fund 800 hours of pediatric cancer research for tumors like Jordan’s. This research means so much to us. Jordan’s neuro-oncologist has had two research projects funded by ALSF. Every dollar we raise benefits children like Jordan in a very tangible way, from an organization founded by a brave hero named Alex that has raised over $65 million in the time since Jordan began her journey 10 years ago.

[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szpN6nn2sMo]

We need your help to reach our goal before the end of the year. Please consider <a title="Slay Cancer Campaign" href="http://www.alexslemonade.org/slaycancer" target="_blank">making a donation in any amount</a>. But more importantly, please help us spread the word. Forward this link on to your friends and family. Tell them that this one honors the girl you’ve been following on the blog for so long–the story of the cancer slayer. Get the word out for Jordan and for all kids with cancer so that we can finish strong.

Thank you. And Happy New Year.]]></content:encoded>

The casts came off the day before Thanksgiving. She was very happy to be free of them. She’s suffering from some painful blood blisters right now, which is keeping her from getting around very well. But she’s happy to have her feet back.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We have an annual Halloween tradition. I asked Jeanette when it started. She was unsure. We think it began the year that Jordan broke the curse–the annual misfortune that struck us in the month of October. In 2004, Jordan was diagnosed. In 2005, she ended up in a wheelchair. In 2006, she was in a coma. But in 2007, we got through the month without any trips to hospitals or setbacks in health. To celebrate that year, only on October 31st, we ordered El Cholo, our favorite Mexican restaurant and an LA tradition. Ever since, we eat El Cholo on Halloween. This year was no different.<!-- more -->

Of course, the story is not that easy. I got a text from Jeanette around 4pm that Jordan had a seizure while out trick-or-treating. It was a big one and the girls were alone about a mile from home. Jeanette sat with Jordan on the street as she wandered in the neuro fields. When she came to, she got up and walked half a mile uphill (I’m not making this up) to the bus stop.

While Jordan usually wants to sleep after a big seizure, she would not negate tradition today. I met the ladies at the restaurant. We toasted the end of the green corn tamales season with rich, delicious food. And The Slayer enjoyed every last bit.

To tradition!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Several years ago I had an epic debate with one of my best friends about whether people are basically good or bad. He argued that most people have an inherent tendency to act according to their self-interests and that this tendency is the basis for all the corruption, intolerance, and inequity in the world. (Despite how that makes him sound, you should know that he’s lovely–actually one of the most positive and friendly people I know.) I countered his argument with the words of Anne Frank, “In spite of everything I still believe that people are really good at heart.” Yesterday was another exhibit in favor of my case.<!--more-->

As I’ve written before, Jordan is tenacious. My sister Lisa jokes that Jordan would make an excellent salesperson because she is a closer. She follows up. She pushes you to specifics. Here’s an example. You might suggest that you and Jordan go out for ice cream one day. She’s going to ask, “when?” You might say, “I’m not sure. Maybe next week.” She’s going to come back with, “how about Tuesday?” If you are skillful enough to dodge a commitment right there and then, you can be sure that she will raise the subject again after a short period of time has passed. Once something is in her head, she will not let up. This lovable and often frustrating character trait has led Jeanette and I to be very careful what we suggest. We couch phrases with, “now, I’m not promising this is going to happen, but…” It’s how we insure against the nagging that is certain to come to us in order to exact a promise. Jordan is always closing. Truthfully, it is part of her magic. The tenacity has saved her life. When she’s channeling that focus and follow-through, she’s practically invincible.

Such was my predicament about a month ago. She and I were sitting in the living room watching television together. We were discussing plans for breakfast over the weekend. She offered to get up at 7am and I said, “that’s too early. I’ll still be at SoulCycle.” Her raised eyebrow was the beginning of my fate and the impetus for our day yesterday.

Necessary backstory: I reached a tipping point with my own health. My blood pressure was on the rise again, even with medication. At my last physical my doctor made it clear that exercise should no longer be viewed as something that would be nice for me to do. She told me I was too young to neglect fitness, especially given my family history of heart problems. Along with changes in diet, she said there was nothing better I could do for my health than to get more active.

My problem is that I hate exercise. Until recently, I never understood all the zealots who preached to me about the power of endorphins. To me, exercise was boring and the time it required could be better used working, being creative, or enjoying time with the family. I’ve tried everything. I’ve jogged. I’ve cycled through gym memberships. I’ve hired countless trainers. It’s never stuck and I’ve never gotten any satisfaction from it. That is, until three months ago when I decided to take a class at SoulCycle.

I attended that first class for two reasons. The first was my doctor’s warning. The second was because I study brands for a living and people I trust kept telling me to take a class because I would be blown away by the brand experience. I was.

It was in this context, of me ranting on daily about my newfound Soul addiction, that Jordan’s raised eyebrow set a series of events in motion.

–Maybe I could go with you to your new gym, Dad.

–I don’t think that would work, honey.

–Why not? When I was little you took me to the gym.

She was right. When she was very little my gym had a daycare center. Once or twice I took Jordan along with me and checked her into daycare while I worked out. But she wasn’t a little kid anymore, and SoulCycle doesn’t have daycare. I tried to explain this to her but I quickly butted up against an ugly reality. SoulCycle is an intense workout. You’re not just spinning. You’re doing crunches and push-ups and lifting weights…all on a stationary bike. While I have seen other parents bring their teenage daughters to a class, there was no way that I could bring Jordan. Forget the fact that I would have a hard time tending to her if she had a seizure, her legs are simply not strong enough to do the workout. And I really didn’t want to tell her this. I hate it when I have to remind her of her limitations. But I did tell her.

She said, “oh” and then got very quiet. I felt an inch tall and pregnant with guilt. That’s what drove me to make my next statement.

–Maybe I could call the studio and see if we could stop by one day when they don’t have any classes going on. I could show you the studio and the bikes we use.

Her face lit up instantly and she said, “I think that would be a good idea!” And then, like clockwork, she followed up with, “when do you think we could do that, Dad?”

I brushed her off, but she raised the topic again that day … and the next. So, I wrote an email to the general inquiry address on the SoulCycle website. I explained the situation and made the request to visit the studio in the downtime. When Jordan asked the next time I was legitimately able to say, “I sent them an email.” This satisfied her but then she asked me if they had responded. It was still the weekend and I told her it would take awhile.

It didn’t.

I got a response first thing Monday morning. It came from headquarters in New York. They had already reached out to my local studio and they told me that they wanted to do more than just open the doors for Jordan. They wanted her to experience the ride. 24 hours later they’d concocted a plan and enlisted the service of my favorite instructor. Jordan was invited in for a 15-minute ride with the staff.
<p style="font-size:2em;font-style:italic;">“In spite of everything I still believe that people are really good at heart.”</p>
My argument was being proven again. Even writing this post right now, a day after the event has happened, I get chills. SoulCycle’s offer still moves and inspires me. These were good people, going beyond self-interests to do something wonderful for a kid they didn’t know at all, and a customer who was still relatively new.

The big question for me was the ride. I know my daughter and I knew that she would want to climb on that bike. But I wasn’t certain she could … or even if it was a good idea. SoulCycle takes place in a dark room with loud music. We’d be pushing Jordan by getting her on the bike. It would be hard to hear her if she felt a seizure coming. I kept thinking the best place for her might be in her wheelchair, observing. But I knew deep down she would never settle for that.

We arrived at 3pm to find a throng of people in the lobby. The studio made a big sign that said “Welcome, Jordan.” We greeted everyone and then Jordan met Molly, my favorite instructor.

If you don’t know SoulCycle, here’s the deal: it’s all about the instructor. Meet an avid rider and you are certain to hear them rave about their favorite instructor(s). You find one or two who motivate you and it’s easy to start sounding like a fanboy. I’m no exception.

In SoulCycle terminology, I’m a “rooster.” I started taking Molly’s 6am classes about two weeks after my very first ride. I’d gone through 2-3 other instructors by that point and, while I liked them well enough, my first class with Molly changed my relationship with the workout and the brand. It’s no surprise that her classes are almost always full. She has the power to rally so much energy in a room. She’s tough but fun. She takes all the pretense out of the workout, encouraging riders to say hello to one another, to challenge yourself because that’s really all that matters, and to never lose sight of the fact that “we’re just dancing on bikes.”

In her classes, Molly achieved something I never thought possible. She made me want to come back. I’d leave the studio drenched in sweat and out of breath, but feeling really good. Feeling happy. Maybe this was that endorphin rush everybody kept talking about. I didn’t know. I just wanted to do it again. I’ve actually caught myself smiling during her workouts. Insanity!

I was eager for Jordan to meet Molly. But you never know what to expect with J. She can sometimes come across as aloof, usually when there’s a lot to process. She was a little reserved as Molly shook her hand, but that didn’t matter because the next words out of Molly’s mouth were, “you want to see where your Dad’s been going?” Jordan said yes and we were wheeling her into the studio. It was perfect. The lights were out. The candles were lit. All the bikes were staged and ready to go. The folks at SoulCycle even decorated them with little glow-in-the-dark bracelets.

<figure class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://40.media.tumblr.com/107106adcf276b534c5b03483f385318/tumblr_inline_nnsjksnwhR1r5aaue_540.jpg" alt="image" /></figure>As I suspected, Jordan wanted to get on the bike, and Molly encouraged her. So I helped her get into some cycling shoes while Molly got a bike setup. Meanwhile, our friends and the SoulCycle staff filtered into the room taking up positions on bikes to the left and right.

Time moved so quickly. Before I could quite process it all I was on a bike to the left of Jordan. She was pedaling. She was riding! Molly cued up some Nick Jonas (a very nice touch!) and started leading a ride just like it was any other class. Five minutes in, Molly ordered us to tap it back, and the professionals cranking on bikes to the left and right complied like it was a gospel choir. The room was electric.

And there was no mercy.

It didn’t matter that I’d taken a full class earlier in the day with her. Molly singled me out and asked Jordan if her dad should turn up the resistance and push harder. Jordan nodded, of course.

Though it was only a 15 minute class, it was a whole SoulCycle experience and just as challenging as the 45 minute version. It was actually more so because I wasn’t focused on my workout. I was focused on Jordan. It was only in reflection, about an hour later, that I truly appreciated how spectacular and special this experience was. I rode next to my daughter in a SoulCycle class! Read that last sentence again. I rode with her, surrounded by friends, and supported by a beautiful community of people.

To be completely candid, my stomach was doing somersaults an hour before the class. Though Jeanette and I have always been public about Jordan’s Journey, this was somehow different. In class, you have to let your guard down and focus on the physical challenge. You’re reminded by the instructors to offload all the worries and distractions waiting outside in the world. They tell you that this is your time. It’s intimate. It’s the reason why classes bond together. It’s why the room is dark. It’s why we form that close relationship of trust with the instructor.

For the past three months I’ve gone to classes three, four, and recently five times a week–always as a relative stranger. I sit towards the back, where I won’t be a distraction. I don’t have allusions that I’m a good rider. I’m working on it, trying to build up strength, but I know I have a long way to go. This experience changes things. I’m no longer a stranger. I’ve let my studio into my life. What they did is profound evidence that I’m in good hands. But I am also now accountable. I <i>have</i> to push myself and keep up what I’ve started. I have to do it for all of them, for Jordan and for myself. That’s kind of scary. And kind of great.

While she might have been cool and coy at the studio that day, Jordan talked about the class constantly until we said goodnight. She worked up quite an appetite, too, wolfing down a well-earned steak a couple of hours later as she and her mother and I reminisced on how powerful the day had been. We’ve been blessed by many emotional steps on these dozen years with cancer. Riding SoulCycle with Jordan is now one of my fondest memories. I am proud to be part of the SoulCycle community and very grateful for the kind, generous and absolutely selfless proof they provided that people are good, and no matter how much adversity we may face we can find hope when we ride together.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In her book, <i>The Happiness Project</i>, Gretchen Rubin argued,  “it is easy to be heavy; hard to be light.” The words have profound meaning for me, and I think most of our family. When we meet people who have followed our blog they often say, “you guys are so positive.” They commend me for finding humor in the many twists and turns of Jordan’s cancer. I tell them that humor has been as necessary for us as medicine. If we allowed ourselves to take the easy path, and wallow in every setback—every decrement in Jordan’s health—I don’t know how we would have been able to support one another. It is sometimes hard to be positive and to celebrate the small victories, but it is necessary.<!--more-->

Yet, we are tired. And, the ebullient six year-old who leapt into the fight against the c-word is now a young lady with battle scars and memories and a growing awareness of what she’s lost. If she were perfectly healthy, she’d be just as likely to discover this angst. She is a teenager after all. But we have grown so accustomed to her effortless and bubbly personality in the midst of true crisis that her brooding and quietness is particularly unsettling.

Yesterday was Valentine’s Day. We don’t do much to celebrate it in our house. Jeanette and I find it to be one of the silliest non-holidays and we decided this year that we would not surrender to over-priced restaurants and the expectation of expensive gifts neither of us need. But I wanted to give both of the ladies in my life a little present–nothing big, just something of the kitschy variety. I found a cute pair of Valentine’s themed socks, and a set of miniature coloring pencils for Jordan. I wrapped them in a box with a smiling cartoon monkey on the front. Jordan’s bedroom door was open and I found her sitting on her bed scanning her iPad. I held the box behind my back, wished her a Happy Valentine’s Day, kissed her on the cheek and presented my gift.

Her response: “okay.”

No smile. No thanks. She barely looked up from her iPad to acknowledge me. It sometimes takes her a bit to spin up in the morning, so I ignored her coolness, smiled and went on with my morning.

Later we decided to lunch together as a family at a local restaurant that Jordan had never been to before. She was hostile to everyone and iced me when I tried to help her with the menu. She refused to make a choice, so I ordered for her. She hesitantly sampled the first course. When she realized it was actually quite tasty, she softened up and gradually engaged in conversation with the rest of us.

I worked my ass off yesterday trying to cheer her. I refused to let her pull me into the shadows of her mood. I was probably annoying everyone else with my “glass is half full” insistence. But, by day’s end the Slayer was nearly herself, though perhaps less talkative than usual. We watched an 80’s movie, as we often do on weekends. When it was over she told me she liked it and then we chatted for a bit. She asked me about some old friends that she’d tried to call. They never return her calls. This troubles her. I explained that it had been so long since they’d seen her. Sometimes friends grow apart. The truth is that the last time Jordan called them it was painfully evident that they had grown-up to be normal teenage girls, who were interested in pop culture and boys and the mundane things that sensationalize a teenager’s life. Jordan couldn’t keep up with the conversation. She just kept asking if they remembered the last time they got together for a slumber party. It broke my heart and no one was to blame. The girls on the other end of the line knew that Jordan was different from other kids. When they were younger, the differences didn’t seem so wide. They probably felt obligated to speak with her. But they couldn’t relate to her. This lack of connection weighs heavily on Jordan. She craves friends.

I told her to keep her head up and know that she will make new friends. That was little solace. She wants her old friends. But she let it go and a few minutes later I was tucking her into bed and enjoying the warmth of a great hug and wishes for sweet dreams.

You have to work for happiness. You can’t expect it to come to you. Ordinarily, Jordan works tirelessly to enjoy life and be happy. Lately, I think she wants a break—to let the unhappy feelings lounge with her. It’s perfectly normal, and perfectly okay. I never want her to feel the pressure to be anything other than herself. And all I can do is try to engage with her, to try and make her laugh, to encourage her to do things that she enjoys, to spend quality time together.

Many years ago, a friend of mine described her participation in a pretty intense yoga regimen. She told me that at nearly every session someone in the room cried. I asked why and she explained that the focus on the body allowed people to flush bad emotions from their mind. I thought to myself, “remind me never to go to yoga with you.”

I started working out again this week. I’ve been frequenting SoulCycle. The former cyclist in me loves the intensity and the music lover relishes the rhythmic approach. I attended a class this morning. It was my third and I’m finally able to keep up. About two thirds of the way through the workout the instructor had us out of the saddle, pushing as hard as we could on resistance with a very high tempo cadence. He kept saying, “this is for you. Don’t give up on yourself.” My body was so ready to be done with the workout but I kept pushing. And then I realized that I was sobbing. This rush of emotion came out of nowhere and I thought of Jordan and all that she had been through and how lucky I was to be on that bike using my legs. I felt an obligation to push harder, to not give up. I was grateful that I was already a sweaty mess with a red face, spinning in a darkened room. No one there knew that I’d just had a bit of what pilots call “an emotional incident.”

I wish that I could say that I left class feeling that I had flushed a feeling. But the heaviness walked back to the car with me. It strapped in to the passenger seat and we rode home together. And when we got there it followed me into the shower.

It is easy to be heavy; hard to be light.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[“When do you think I’ll be able to get out of this wheelchair?” she asks.

It’s a straightforward question; one that she has asked before. “I don’t know,” is the easiest reply but it also feels like a cop out. So, I answer her honestly.<!--more-->

“You may never get rid of the wheelchair completely.”

There’s a moment. I let the silence envelop us and resist the urge to fill it with appeasing affirmations. She squints her eyes when she thinks hard on something. She is squinting now. She looks beyond me, into a wide space of her own thoughts. Finally, she returns.

“So, I’m never going to get out of this wheelchair?”

“I’m not saying that.”

“Because of the seizures?”

“No,” I say. “It’s because of what the cancer has done.”

We speak again about how cancer damages healthy tissue. In her case, we think it damaged parts of her brain that tell her feet how to move properly. On top of that, chemotherapy may have damaged nerve endings in her feet.

She is squinting at me again. Her face is expressionless. I wonder if she is feeling sad or if she is merely processing the idea.

“Well,” she says. “I do hope I can get rid of it&nbsp;one day.”

It's not lost on me that "it" could be the chair or the cancer.&nbsp;

I agree with her and&nbsp;ask if she worries about life with the wheelchair&nbsp;a lot. She says no, but tells me that she does think about getting out of it from time to time.&nbsp;She says she wonders more about whether or not she will have children. She is confused a bit on this topic as well, thinking her seizure disorder is the potential barrier to her future family life. I explain to her that it also has more to do with chemotherapy. Some of the drugs that she took to fight tumors can make women&nbsp;infertile. We don’t know if they&nbsp;affected her this way, but it’s a possibility.&nbsp;

I feel this conversation is quickly becoming a downer. The Slayer doesn’t let that be the case.

“You would be a good grandpa,” she says with a smile. “Because you like to tease so much. You're good at teasing me!”

And there it is. Hope and humor and my girl.

She doesn’t know how often I think about these topics—her future independence, her ability to have a family of her own. I choose not to tell her and instead let the thoughts and feelings scatter through my mind like wayward children. A few minutes later we are laughing about the antics of our dog Gracie. A wide smile takes residence on her face, and the squinting is done for now. A little while later she crawls up to her room and lounges in a pair of her favorite pajamas, sorting through&nbsp;photos on her bed and updating her Pinterest page.

These metaphysical conversations about her future are infrequent, but surface they do. I am usually unprepared. There is rarely a preemptive warning. No moody behavior. No emotional outburst. She snatches them from the air as if they were drifting dandelion seeds. When they take root she wants to get my opinion on their nature. Occasionally, she’ll whine or express frustration at my responses, but she is most often impassive. She trusts me to be candid. On the few occasions when I have sugar-coated an answer, she’s called me on it.

She counts on me to help her get it right.

A few years ago, I printed every page of this blog. It wasn’t a retaliation against trees but rather a concern that <em>Jordan’s Journey</em> only existed in a cloud. I felt better knowing we had a hard copy. This is a history. It is different from the kind of history you’d find in the medical records of her physicians and hospitals. It traces more of a&nbsp;spiritual life. Though I wish this blog was in her own voice, I've tried to capture the girl in all her beguiling&nbsp;ways as she's traveled through significant events and milestones.&nbsp;There's a lot of me set down in this recorded history, but the intent is to capture the life and mind of the beautiful character we call Jordan.

Last week, I pulled the printed version down from the shelf. It lives in a binder, three inches wide. The journey is printed on both sides of the several hundred pages. The depth alone is a sober reminder of how long we’ve been at this.

I flipped through the pages for over an hour, reminding myself of episodes I’d not recalled for a long time. Sometimes, I felt the sucker punches all over again—the horrible setbacks and gut-wrenching struggles like <a title="Back Again" href="http://jordanvincent.com/2005/08/21/back-again/" target="_blank">Jordan’s ill-fated 7th&nbsp;birthday</a> and the onset of seizures, or the day she began <a title="October Curse" href="http://jordanvincent.com/2006/10/16/october-curse/" target="_blank">a week-long comatose absence</a>. There was the realization that the<a title="Event Horizon" href="http://jordanvincent.com/2010/07/12/event-horizon/" target="_blank">&nbsp;tumor in her spine</a>&nbsp;was growing again, and <a title="Word Games" href="http://jordanvincent.com/2010/08/01/word-games/" target="_blank">the long, hard conversation with the gentle doctor</a> in Chicago. But just as often I felt pride in the triumph of Jordan’s will, the resilience of my family, and the hope we’ve always tried to muster. There was <a title="Quest for The Hard Ones" href="http://jordanvincent.com/2007/01/09/wish-day-2-quest-for-the-hard-ones/" target="_blank">the time she scaled the rock wall</a> months after intense physical therapy to walk again. There was <a title="What a Day!" href="http://jordanvincent.com/2011/08/22/what-a-day/" target="_blank">the grand birthday celebration at the hospital</a> days after her riskiest surgery. There was <a title="An Unassuming Hero" href="http://jordanvincent.com/2004/12/07/an-unassuming-hero/" target="_blank">the way her brother comforted her</a> and showed a bravery that made her feel absolutely normal.

This trip down memory lane was mostly healing and uplifting. Only one aspect troubled me. As I traced the journey from its beginning I was reminded of the massive changes in Jordan's personality. The character I've labored to capture has mellowed. She was once a rambunctious force. Early entries chronicle a girl who raised the roof with tantrums and laughter, often in the same space and time. She was a girl who ran and danced and made us laugh because of her penchant for silliness. Recent entries paint a picture of a different girl—a girl who is often quiet. A girl who seems to reside mostly in her own head; who squints and thinks deeply about her future. Jordan was once a girl who shed crocodile tears at the Spongebob Squarepants movie (much to her brother’s chagrin).&nbsp; She now says that she cannot cry—that she rarely feels the urge. While she still has moments of extreme joy and unapologetic anger, these mountains of temperament are divided by an increasingly large and mellow valley of blankness.

The physical effects of cancer are easy to observe. Though difficult at times, they can be managed. The mental effects are much harder. I can imagine a life for Jordan that is constantly attached to a wheelchair. I can imagine a life for her that is childless. These potential realities sadden me. But what I find hard to imagine is a life for her that is always attached to uncertainty and increasingly Jordan-less.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[“You would be a good grandpa,” she says with a smile. “Because you like to tease so much. You’re good at teasing me!... The physical effects of cancer are easy to observe and capable to process. The mental effects are much harder. I can imagine a life for Jordan that is constantly attached to a wheelchair. I can imagine a life for her that is childless. While these potential realities sadden me now and then, nothing makes me more melancholy than the thought of a life for her that is always attached to uncertainty and increasingly Jordan-less.”... I am in tears, here!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[She looked up from her iPad and smiled coyly when he entered the room. Then she looked down again and pecked at the screen. The corner of her mouth was frozen in a slight smirk.

"Hello, sweetheart. How are you today?"<!--more-->

Dr. Jonathan Finlay was Jordan's neuro-oncologist from the very beginning of the journey. In fact, he was the one who delivered the fateful cancer diagnosis to us back in 2004. He has guided every decision we have made over more than a decade of treatments. His grey-bearded face is perpetually smiling. His eyes cast a twinkle behind scholarly glasses. He's an optimist despite being British. The smooth lilt of his English accent only adds to his charming blend of hope.

Jordan loves Dr. Finlay. She was as sad as we were when he left Children's Hospital last year to take up a new post in Cleveland. He still monitors Jordan's progress, though. He says she is his patient for life.

I choose this encounter between Dr. Finlay and Jordan a few years ago because it was prophetic.

On that day, Dr. Finlay's "glass is half full" demeanor was even more enthusiastic than usual. The scans from an MRI of Jordan's brain and spine looked very good.The tumor was not only stable, it might have gotten smaller. Jeanette and I sighed with relief while Jordan kept her focus on an iPad game of mahjong.

With worries about the tumor's progress out of the way, our conversation with Dr. Finlay switched to quality of life. How was Jordan doing otherwise, he asked.

Without looking up from her screen, Jordan said, "I really want to read."

Finlay looked over at us and we explained that Jordan had been working harder at school on her reading skills, but she was still struggling. She did well with some sight words like "the" and "and," but she couldn't grasp the basic code that you and I use to translate clusters of letters into words. A lot of what she called reading was guessing, and it frustrated her. She would sit in her room leafing through piles of books imagining what they said. She loved it when Jeanette or I read to her, and her comprehension was very strong, but she really wanted to read on her own.

Finlay talked with Jordan for a bit, asking her questions about her attempts. He empathized with her desire to read, and encouraged her to keep trying. And then he told her not to give up. The brain, he said, is an amazing part of the body that often "rewires itself." In other words, many patients with brain tumors lose cognitive abilities only to find new ways of coping. The biology of the brain can quite literally change as our mind attempts other ways to do something it did before but couldn't do the same way now.

Dr. Finlay's prediction has come true, although not in the way we imagined. Jordan has become wonderfully creative and resourceful when it comes to communicating outside of normal speech. Her iPhone and iPad are her gateway.

There are a number of apps available to help people with disabilities. In fact, there are some really impressive features built-in to iOS. But Jordan doesn't rely much on these. She uses the tools you and I take for granted to sidestep a need for writing and reading words.

For example, yesterday I received a text message with an audio file attachment. When I listened there was Jordan's voice saying hello and wishing me a happy day. She couldn't type the words, but she found a clever way to text with me. I recorded a brief audio message back. Shortly after came a happy face in reply.

[caption id="attachment_730" align="alignnone" width="300"]<img class="wp-image-730 size-medium" src="https://jordansjourney.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/audioex.jpg?w=300" alt="Audio Messages from Jordan" width="300" height="147" /> Examples of the audio messages Jordan texts me throughout a typical day[/caption]

She uses emoticons more and more. Here's one she sent me recently when she wanted to let me know it was time for me to come up and tuck her in.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-731 size-medium" src="https://jordansjourney.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/jordan_emoticons.jpg?w=212" alt="Jordan_Emoticons" width="212" height="300" />

Her phone's camera is a particularly clever part of her communications repertoire. She takes photos of things she likes, just like you and me. But she also uses the camera to send messages. The photo below was sent to me last weekend. When she was downstairs with me, she asked if I would help her tie the drawstring on her lounge pants because she has trouble with it. Then she went upstairs to get ready for the day. About 10 minutes later this photo came through—a signal that she was ready for me to help her. She often uses photos in this way.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-732 size-medium" src="https://jordansjourney.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/img_1415.jpg?w=225" alt="IMG_1415" width="225" height="300" />

And, she has mastered some basic words and letter codes. The most vital text she relies on is a 2-letter pair: SZ. It's her signal that she feels a seizure coming. She often gets it backwards, but ZS works just as well for Jeanette and I. These two letters have created an efficient shorthand for all of us and allows us to keep Jordan safe.

All of these compensating uses of her phone were developed by Jordan, and great proof that Dr. Finlay was right about the desire of the mind to find "another way." It's also proof of The Slayer's greatest quality: her tenacity. She views an obstacle as something to work around. She does this with compelling resolve. She loves to tell me that she never gives up. And she never has.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[This is amazing to read. In a similar way, my mother, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's just a few months ago, has come to depend on her technology - iPhone mainly. She has lost the understanding of how to "dial", but thanks to Siri she can connect with anyone in her network. We have made sure everyone's name and number have been entered correctly, and all she has to do is ask Siri to text or call whomever it is she wants to speak to. It also gives her reminders to take her meds - which she would be unable to do on her own - which means I don't have to get a nurse in her home for no reason other than taking her meds once a day. As much as I sometimes find myself frustrated by the addiction everyone has to our tech, I have to remember the benefits it is to those who use it in ways much more wisely than I.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Much madness is divinest sense
to a discerning eye.
—Emily Dickinson</blockquote>
Thursday was a big day. Jordan invited me to sit in on her weekly physical therapy session. She loves Kristy, her physical therapist, and she has been bragging to me about their workouts for months. She was excited to show me the studio where they train because she said it was filled with so much fun equipment and games.

In typical Jordan fashion, she nagged me about this visit constantly. We finally set a day and locked it down on my office calendar. My assistant cleared my afternoon of any appointments so that Jordan would have my full and undivided attention.

Jordan was so excited about this day that she planned what she would wear a few days before. She gave me a primer on what to expect the night before. She kept asking me to confirm that it was on my calendar. This was a big deal to her.<!--more-->

That’s why it was odd when I arrived. I expected Jordan to be bubbling with enthusiasm. Instead, she barely acknowledged me, staring down at her phone. I smiled at Jeanette and asked what was up. Jeanette told me Jordan had a small seizure earlier in the day, so it might be making her mellow.

We were all early to the appointment, so we spent the next 10-15 minutes in the lobby sitting in relative silence, each of us on a device of some sort until it was time and Kristy came out to meet us. That’s when Jordan started perking.

“It’s the big day,” Kristy said. “Are you ready to take your Dad back and show him what we do?”

Jordan said yes and then started rattling off some obscure backstories from our past. She bolted up out of her chair and nearly lost her balance. We turned to head down the hall and I felt Jordan grab on to my shoulders. She wanted me to give her a piggy back ride. I said no, because I was wearing a jacket and also because she was here to work.

This set her off. As quick as she was enthusiastic she was now cross. She furrowed her brow and started snapping at people.

When Kristy held on to Jordan’s gait belt for support as they walked down the hall, the tempest unleashed.

“Let go of me! I can walk by myself. Don’t treat me like a baby.”

Of course, it wasn’t at all safe for Jordan to walk by herself. That’s why she wears a gait belt, so that someone can help her balance and keep her from falling. Kristy explained this to Jordan, but Jordan already knew. It didn’t matter. She insisted on independence. She was mad and rude and shouting at the very person she was most excited for me to meet. And Kristy was brilliant in her response—firm, unapologetic, and even-handed.

I backed off to give them space to work it out. I was annoyed because there was so much energy baked into this afternoon and now it could end up being a wash. When Jordan gets into this headspace she can be very hard to reorient. She has to back her way out on her terms. Facing the prospect that the session might be cancelled entirely, Jordan relented and allowed Kristy to support her on the walk down the long hallway to the studio. I followed and listened to my girl make sarcastic and rude comments in response to Kristy’s easy questions and small talk.

We turned a corner and I got my first glance at the the studio. It is a vibrant, playful working space with a mix of exercise equipment and children’s toys. Huge oak beams cross the ceiling with ropes and fasteners dangling down for use in training. A couple of huge skylights flooded the room with natural light. Most of the floor was covered in thick pads like you’d find in a gymnasium. Children of various ages were already at work, laughing and raising their voices as they worked with their therapists. It was a room with lively energy. I could see why Jordan loved coming here every week.

I took a seat in a row of chairs off to the side while Jordan and Kristy took a seat on a large padded bench that was suspended from the ceiling by rope. Jordan grabbed on to a couple of rings that hung independently in front of the bench. A few seconds later, she pulled on the rings and kicked her legs to get the bench swinging high off the ground. Kristy held her back in support and then slowly started adding resistance. I kept my eyes focused on Jordan. Her mood was changing. I could tell from her face that she was beginning to enjoy herself, and that she was getting to work.

When they finished on the swinging bench, they hit the mats doing pushups and abdominal work. Jordan was focused now, and I was inspired by her strength. She is stronger than she looks. She’s thin and wiry, but her core is solid and powerful.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-757" src="https://jordansjourney.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/img_2655.jpg" alt="Floor Work" width="702" height="936" />

Finally, the most anticipated moment came to pass: the game play. Jordan has been telling me for such a long time about these games. I never understood how they worked, but I knew that Jordan loved them.

Kristy fetched a board game they called Snail Race. Five colored plastic snails were set on one end of the board. The box lid was used as a place to throw two multi-colored dice. The colors that are rolled correlate with a snail on the board. So, a red face means the red snail could move a square. Two red faces and the red snail can move two squares.

Jordan extended her body over a padded bench facing up. Kristy put weight against Jordan’s legs. The board was to Jordan’s left, the box lid to her right. To throw the dice, Jordan twisted her upper body to the right, extending her arm to reach and throw the die. Then, when the colors were determined, Jordan twisted in the opposite direction to move the snails. This clever gameplay created an effective way for Jordan to work her oblique abdominal muscles. And because she was so excited about the game (and showing me how to play it) she crunched these muscles with a lot of vigor and enthusiasm.

[caption id="attachment_758" align="alignnone" width="702"]<img class="size-full wp-image-758" src="https://jordansjourney.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/img_2656.jpg" alt="Board games like Snail Race are a clever backdrop for rigorous abdominal work" width="702" height="936" /> Board games like Snail Race are a clever backdrop for rigorous abdominal work[/caption]

Later, they played a similar game with Jordan’s legs extended on a bench. This time she faced the floor. Kristy held a game piece in the air above Jordan’s head. To get it, Jordan had to lift one arm up and into the air to grab it, all while stabilizing her body with the other arm. Her balance is impressive. Watching them rotate between arms was like watching a ballet.

By the time it was over, Jordan was her usual self. While she worked up a little bit of a sweat, her humor had returned. She was talkative and eager to come back next week.

[caption id="attachment_760" align="alignnone" width="702"]<img class="size-full wp-image-760" src="https://jordansjourney.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/20150604_misc_006.jpg" alt="Jordan and Kristy at the end of the workout together" width="702" height="469" /> Jordan and Kristy at the end of the workout together[/caption]

I’m not sure what set off the temper tantrum. It might have been the seizure earlier in the day. It might have been all the expectation and energy invested in this one Thursday afternoon. When we got in the car I asked Jordan what happened. She said she didn’t want to talk about it. We told her we could move on for the time being, but we eventually wanted to discuss it more. She told me later that she felt bad about yelling at Kristy and that she would apologize to her, but she still didn’t feel comfortable explaining to me why she behaved as she did. It’s possible she doesn’t really know.

Nevertheless, I am glad I got to experience the workout. We have been so fortunate on Jordan’s Journey. We’ve been led to really gifted, caring people who make a difference in our daughter’s life. Kristy is one of those great souls. She and Jordan have been working together for several years and it’s a perfect fit.

Kristy encourages Jordan to bring her iPad to their workouts. They play Jordan’s favorite music. When they kicked off that bench swing, Britney Spears was belting out “Toxic” on the iPad. Kristy makes her work hard. She doesn’t coddle her. But she does give Jordan a lot of support and a desire to reach for more. She does this so well that Jordan practices some of the floor exercises on her own at home. I sometimes spy her doing Supermans on the living room rug. She’s even asked me to join her on occasion. And I've obliged. But she's always the superhero.

Send J a friendly reassuring "G'day" from Australia! [waves a happy hello].

You GO, Supergirl!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Friday, July 18, 1986. A group of my closest friends and I pile into a car and drive to Westwood from Orange County. I was 17 and this was a frequent weekend ritual for us. Orange County was boring and we loved to venture north to go to the then-reigning capital of movie releases. Back in those days, Westwood had movie theatres on almost every corner, and it was THE place to go to see a motion picture with THX and Dolby sound and a coterie of new technologies that made movies better.

My friends and I had also been experimenting with making movies of our own. We borrowed video and Super 8 cameras and created little pieces that today would be a great fit for YouTube. Back then, our audience was a small circle of friends who would gather together and drink beer while watching our handiwork. And that was perfectly fine. We had more fun making the movies than we did distributing and exhibiting.

But Friday, July 18th was a watershed moment. It was the night I pledged that I would go to film school. It was the opening night of James Cameron's <i>Aliens</i>. Little did I know that it would also be the beginning of a great chapter in Jordan's Journey.
<!--more-->

I know what you're thinking. You're thinking my watershed moment should have been&nbsp;<i>Lawrence of Arabia</i>, or <i>Vertigo</i>, or <i>Citizen Kane</i>. By 1986 I'd seen all those films and loved them. <i>Aliens</i> was a popcorn movie--a sequel to a great Ridley Scott original--but 5 minutes in I was completely mesmerized by what the film was doing to me. I was on the edge of my seat. That movie, at that moment in time, was a rollercoaster ride that blew my teenage mind.

I had been flirting with USC. My mother told me there was no way I could go there. We couldn't afford it, she said. "Once again," she reminded me, "you have Nordstrom taste on a Sears budget." But every time I visited the campus my desire to be part of it grew. And on July 18th I made up my mind that I would go there and that I would get into the film school.

29 years later that day is still a part of my life, but not the way I imagined. I did go to USC. I did attend the film school. And while I didn't pursue a career in filmmaking, I am so proud of that wonderful chapter. It was not just my college years, which were some of the most rewarding of my entire life. It was also my fondness of movies in that era. There were a lot of bad movies, but there were also movies that I'll never forget. These were the movies of my formative years.

I wanted to share these movies with my children. I wanted them to have the same cinematic vernacular of my teenage years. So I came up with an idea. Let's do 80's movie night.

I floated this concept with Luc first. He loves movies and I thought this would be a perfect father/son activity. But I got no satisfaction.

"Nah," he said. "I'm more interested in the new stuff."

I was dumbfounded.&nbsp;

The new stuff? Really?&nbsp;

In my head were a stream of films that shaped my adolescence--films I wanted my son to experience, too. <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark. The Empire Strikes Back. Romancing the Stone. The Goonies. Blue Velvet. Baghdad Cafe. Platoon.</i>..I could go on and on.

He was polite and he smiled when he said, "maybe." I knew I hadn't made the sale.

I shelved this idea for awhile until Jordan started asking to watch movies with me. On a flyer I said, "how would you like to watch 80's movies with Dad?"

"That sounds awesome, " she said.

Truthfully, she may not have realized what she'd just committed to. I'm not sure she understood that she would be subjected to images of terrible fashion trends, forced montages, and poppy music soundtracks that featured a meandering saxophone solo.&nbsp;

I explained that these were the movies I grew up with. They were old. Some probably weren't as good as I remembered. I'd be okay if she said no.

I expected her to shrug me off, too, after this consumer warning. But instead she seemed to get more excited.

Thus began a cinematic retrospective that has been going on for over a year; one that we have loved. At least once a week Jordan and I gather in the living room and cue up a film that was released between 1980 and 1989. We haven't watched <i>Aliens</i> yet, but we've sure covered a lot of other ground. Not all of them are "classics." Some are downright horrible (<i>Troop Beverly Hills</i>). Some are better in my memory (<i>Three Men and a Baby:</i>&nbsp;doesn't hold up well). Others withstand the test of time (<i>Beverly Hills Cop:&nbsp;</i>still solid).

Sometimes we binge. For example, we've taken to screening a different movie every night of three-day weekends. President's Day weekend we watched "<i>Groundhog Day", "Back to the Future,"</i> and "<i>Victor/Victoria</i>." It was epic.

Eventually, we will run out of 80's movies. I suppose we'll have to move on to other eras. But I highly recommend this experiment to those who lived those movies like I did. The Slayer has been very fond of going back to the future with me.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I would call it a passive summer. There were no major milestones; no setbacks. It was as if we put our lives in neutral, reclined the seat, and napped for awhile with our hats over our eyes all-the-while keeping the engine running, just in case. My superstitious side grows restless when we enjoy a spell like this. I wonder if it is the universe's way of preparing us for the next mile. But then I counsel my fears to stop being silly and relish the fact that The Slayer is well and she and I have enjoyed/endured a season of terrific normality.<!--more-->

Yesterday, while we were out for dinner, I watched her walk back from the ladies room. Every step was deliberate, her spindly legs elongating like a praying mantis then resting briefly to catch balance. She doesn't have much of the latter, so she supported herself by bracing her hands against a passing booth and sometimes a table. The guests were often startled until they looked up and saw the smiling pixie making her way back to her table.

That's how Jordan weathers through the challenges: unapologetically and with a smile. Her eyes reveal true grit, but her mouth wears a smirk that matches her life motto: never give up.

"That's just how life is," she tells me. "You can't control it. You have to go with the flow."

Others taught her these slogans and affirmations, but she has made them her own. She believes each and every one, and lives accordingly. It's how she propels herself through all the setbacks and challenges and sudden turns we didn't see coming. Jordan understands that life is more a mental game than it is a physical one.

In August we started reading together again. I'm ashamed to say I let this habit lapse. Jordan can't read on her own, but she loves to be read to. My friend Kassie gave me and Jordan a copy of <em>Walk Two Moons</em>, by Sharon Creech. Every night before bed I come up to Jordan's room, plop down in her stylishly pink beanbag chair, and read a couple of chapters. We're nearly finished.

While we read, Jordan sits up in her bed, propped by a couple of overstuffed pillows. She multitasks, using a tray to color or work on some craft. Every so often, when something interesting happens in the story, she'll pause and look over at me, her eyes deep-set into the world we're exploring together. Then she goes back to her handiwork.

She listens intently. Sometimes, I quiz her ... just to be sure she's paying attention. Her comprehension and recall are amazing.

I forgot how much Jordan loves words. Inspired by her interest, I started reading her a sonnet every night, after the story. I tell her, "don't worry if you don't understand the words. Just listen to them. Enjoy them." After the fourth or fifth night of counseling her this way she moaned, "I know, I know, Dad. I get it."

Last night I read her sonnet #17.
<blockquote>Who will believe my verse in time to come,
If it were fill'd with your most high deserts?</blockquote>
After I tucked her in, I thought about these words. If I were to come upon this blog many years from now, I'm not sure I would believe all that I have written about The Slayer. She's a remarkable young woman. I am lucky to enjoy this life with her; lucky to be her father. On this journey of more than a decade, I have been drawn to some very dark corners. But a little quality time with Jordan leads me back to a sound path. Though she says she knows it, I don't think she understands how much of an impact she can have on those around her. She radiates.

This morning during the latter part of my SoulCycle ride, I closed my eyes in the darkened room and let my thoughts drift. In my stream of consciousness, I enjoyed a vision of my girl. She was running--not angling her limbs like an awkward spider wearing ankle weights, but full-on running. If it were a movie, my camera view was slightly behind her, tracking with her. Every so often she would glance back at me over her shoulder, her cheeks a delightful pink, her mouth a toothy smile. She runs so fast in this vision that I struggle to keep up with her...

I know it sounds mystical, but these occasional projections give me hope. They inspire me. That's why there was a big smile on my face as I turned up the resistance and pushed just a wee bit harder in my workout.

While it is very unlikely that I will ever see that day when Jordan flat-out sprints across an open field, I can always help her find the rush that should accompany life—I can commit to pushing her in other ways, and letting her spirit run free. That's what it's like when we read, when we do photography projects, when we go out exploring museums and concerts and plotting new adventures.

It was a passive summer. And we are rested. It's now time to challenge life again.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Words spilled out of her mouth in a frenzy. It was as though her lips and tongue couldn't keep up with her stream of consciousness. She hopped from topic to topic with delight, adding nuance to one recollection while cutting to the chase on another. We had a hard time keeping up with her, but our brunch table giggled from her animation. I joked that she sounded like a caffeinated squirrel.

“Dad,” she exclaimed. “It isn’t nice to call your only daughter names.”

[caption id="attachment_905" align="alignleft" width="300"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-905" src="https://jordansjourney.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/20150912_raw_alsf_063.jpg?w=300" alt="Larry and Jordan pose at the LA Loves Alex's event to support Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation" width="300" height="300" /> Larry and Jordan pose at the LA Loves Alex's event to support Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation[/caption]

But my scolding was temporary. She had more anecdotes to share with her Uncle Ricky and Aunt Lisa. They had flown down from Portland to join us for a weekend of culinary delight in the service of a good cause. Saturday was LA Loves Alex’s, an annual fundraising event for <a href="http://www.alexslemonade.org" target="_blank">Alex’s Lemonade Stand Foundation</a> that draws some of the country’s finest chefs to Los Angeles for an outdoor feast. Four years ago, <a href="http://jordanvincent.com/2011/11/06/being-a-hero-ambassador/" target="_blank">Jordan and I spoke at the event</a>. It was Jordan’s very first public speaking experience. She rallied the crowd with her mantra, “let’s keep kicking cancer’s butt together.”

Our family is so proud to be associated with ALSF. In its relatively short life it has raised over $100 million, and earned one of the highest charity ratings in the industry. Saturday’s event broke records. Over 2,000 people attended, and they raised more than $1 million in a single day. Even Jordan’s breath was taken away by the energy of the auction, when one item alone brought in $150,000.

“Wow! That’s a lot,” she said to me.

The weekend activities got me thinking about two words that often get tossed about in cancer rhetoric. The first is the notion of the hero. Jordan is a very proud “hero ambassador” for ALSF. And she certainly fits every definition of hero in my book. But it dawned on me that children like Jordan don’t aim to be heroes. They just want to be kids. They’d gladly relinquish their title if it meant a life without cancer. Jordan would be thrilled to trade in her title to run again, or leave the house without accompaniment because of fear of seizures. These kids earn heroic respect because they do everything they can to clear cancer out of life’s way so they can live life the way it should be lived.

Alex Scott was a true hero. Hearing her mother Liz recount stories about Alex’s life brought me to tears, as they always do. Take a moment and think about the fact that this very young cancer fighter started a movement with a single lemonade stand, aiming to raise money to help her doctors find cures for <em>all</em> children. What started as a day bringing in a jar full of cash has turned into events like Saturday’s, raising seven figures. Jordan relates to Alex’s story very much, not because Alex was a hero but because Alex’s story is about living and doing.

That brings me to the second word. Losing. During her speech, Liz Scott said that she rejects the phrase “lost her battle with cancer.” Alex, she said, did not lose. Though the disease cost her life, Alex’s spirit and efforts to do something about cancer were so ambitious and wonderfully fruitful that it’s just plain illogical to think of it all as a loss. A life of love and determination and dreaming is quite an accomplishment. I tell Jordan this whenever I can. Her loving, determined take on life inspires me and many others. It’s why I get so smitten when she’s rattling off stories and non sequiturs so fast we race to follow her.

A life packed with purpose and an abundance of dreams cannot be a loss.

Saturday was significant in another way. 2,000 miles across the country, dozens and dozens of riders mounted Harley-Davidsons and rode two-lane country roads through Illinois farm country to carry my Uncle Pat’s ashes to his grave site. My uncle was one of my heroes and his long battle with cancer was certainly <em>not</em> measured in the loss column. He influenced so many people with his positive attitude and optimistic drive. Just a few months ago, with the cancer spreading so much that he found it difficult to breathe and required supplementary oxygen to get by, he still got on his Harley with my Aunt Jane and toured eight southern states, traveling over 1,800 miles. He later told me that the trip probably “did me in.” But, he said, it was worth it. That’s the man he was. There was always more life to be lived.

Uncle Pat was a big supporter of Jordan. In fact, he told me that he thought about her during some of his most challenging treatments and therapies. He said, “if that little girl can fight so bravely without complaint, so can I.” Pat was a natural with kids—a pied piper with my cousins and all their offspring. And he charmed Jordan very much. When he learned how much she loved Brooks Ketchup (which is sadly not sold west of the Mississippi) he would send her boxes packed full of bottles for our pantry. And, when he prepared to say goodbye, he made arrangements for his friends and family to donate to ALSF rather than send flowers. In the obituary that he wrote for himself, he said “flowers are pretty but there are kids out there that need our help more than I need flowers.”

My uncle did not lose his battle with cancer. He proved himself a hero and he lived his life fully despite the challenges that cancer threw at him. Most importantly, he positively affected the lives of so many. Like Alex Scott, Pat’s giant heart and abundant humor proved that we have the power to make this life our own, even when cancer shortens it.

The impact of this breed of heroism was on display Saturday as row after row of Harley riders clogged lanes on the way to the Cottonwood Cemetery in Hanna City, Illinois. And it was abundant in the rounds of giving taking place on the Royce Hall Quad in West Los Angeles.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[While I was in New York last week I spoke at a fundraising event hosted by my friend and mentor, Alan Siegel. It benefited the <a href="http://www.pablove.org" target="_blank">The Pablove Foundation</a>'s <a href="http://www.pablove.org/shutterbugs/" target="_blank">Shutterbugs</a> program—a photography workshop for children living with cancer, of which Jordan was an inaugural student back in 2011. I’ve written about the <a href="http://jordanvincent.com/2011/05/14/the-artist-speaks/" target="_blank">Pablove Shutterbugs Show</a> and the impact it had on the Slayer. One of my goals last Thursday was to demonstrate that impact for the room of potential supporters. But as I prepared for the event I reflected on the role photography has played throughout Jordan’s Journey.<!--more-->

<a href="http://www.moma.org/collection/artists/3373" target="_blank">Dorothea Lange</a>, the great depression-era documentary photographer, wrote “photography is taking a moment in time, altering life by holding it still.” Indeed, photography has helped us preserve moments in time, and it has altered our family life from the beginning of Jordan’s Journey.

Here’s a moment in time. The photo below is the Slayer one day before she was diagnosed with cancer.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-918" src="https://jordansjourney.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/jordan_prediagnosis.jpg" alt="Jordan Before Diagnosis" width="768" height="835" />

Weeks before we took this photo, we’d had a series of meetings with Jordan’s kindergarten teacher, who noted acute changes in Jordan’s cognitive abilities. She was having a hard time remembering things. Her speech patterns were unusual. She couldn’t quite grasp or verbalize differences in basic shapes.

Then, a routine MRI revealed a surprising change inside Jordan’s brain—a mass of enhancements appeared in the scan. They covered the entire surface of her brain and spine. On the eve of surgery to biopsy and gather tissue samples, we took her to the playground and captured this shot. It’s hard for me to remember that little girl. It was a dozen years ago, which is why it is so precious to me that this moment in time is held still.

The photo below was taken by Jeanette while we were on vacation in Hawaii, a few months after Jordan began her first round of chemotherapy. She was actually doing quite well then. But for some reason, I started crying while she and I stood on the shore looking out at the ocean. I didn’t want her to see me like that so I turned to walk it off. Jordan, being a fun-loving six year-old, turned and started following me, walking in my footsteps. I caught on to her sport, gathered my composure, and then we made a game of it. My wife did what good photographers do. She waited for the right moment and captured a perfect memory. Perhaps more than any other, this image altered our lives because it became symbolic of the journey ahead. While it has often reminded me how important it is for me and Jeanette to be strong and set the right tone for Jordan, if I were to stage this photo it would be more accurate to have me walking in Jordan’s footsteps. She has always been the source of our optimism, strength and humor.

<a href="http://jordanvincent.com/2007/01/09/wish-day-2-quest-for-the-hard-ones/" target="_blank">I wrote about the image</a> below right after it occurred. It’s from Jordan’s Make-A-Wish trip to Orlando.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920" src="https://jordansjourney.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/353355676_bbcb92a2e4_o.jpg" alt="Jordan and the Rock Wall" width="544" height="800" />

Jordan loves rock walls, but she could never really scale them because of the weakness in her legs. The year before this photo was taken she was completely wheelchair-bound, the result of a rare reaction to Vincristine, a fairly common chemotherapy drug. But Jordan re-learned to walk through intense physical therapy. And, on this day, she surprised us all when, engaged in an intense competitive rivalry with her brother, she willed herself up that wall and rang the bell. It’s a wonder that we were able to take the photos. Our eyes were so wet.

Finally, the photo below was taken in 2011, just minutes before Jordan was wheeled into the operating room for <a href="http://jordanvincent.com/2011/07/20/without-many-words/" target="_blank">her riskiest surgery</a>—one to remove a tumor growing on her spine.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-921" src="https://jordansjourney.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/6008248679_8be5c70cd0_o.jpg" alt="Jordan Pre-Op" width="800" height="598" />

We were told there was a 50/50 chance that the surgery alone would render her paralyzed from the waist down. But the risks of doing nothing with the tumor were far greater. As I captured this image, Jordan was losing patience. She wanted to “get it over with.” Her resolve humbled me then as it does now. When I look back on this photo I am filled with the same anxiety and tension that I felt then, but it is mixed with a healthy dose of pride and love for my daughter’s relentless fighting spirit. To me, this is an image of strength and courage. So, too, is the image below thatI caught 24 hours later. It's of Jordan taking <a href="http://jordanvincent.com/2011/08/06/magic/" target="_blank">her first steps after surgery</a>.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-927" src="https://jordansjourney.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/tumblr_lyuf9uabkd1rn5v6ko7_1280.jpg" alt="Jordan Post-Op" width="800" height="533" />

Photography has done more for us than help us keep a record of where we’ve been and what we’ve overcome. It has provided Jordan and I with an outlet to be creative, to work through emotions, to take our minds off of cancer-fighting and to play. I’ve posted many of our collaborative sessions over the years. Jordan is always more than willing to be the subject in my experimental setups and portrait concepts. She truly is my muse. The photos below illustrate.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-922" src="https://jordansjourney.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/4138763800_baebf799ab_o.jpg" alt="Jordan and Larry Thanksgiving Setup" width="800" height="530" />

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-923" src="https://jordansjourney.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/6664051001_f49a9cc35d_o.jpg" alt="Jordan and Larry Goofing" width="800" height="533" />

<img class="alignnone wp-image-924 size-full" src="https://jordansjourney.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/3851372234_f63a435e28_o-e1442775647946.jpg" alt="Jordan Series" width="4410" height="2002" />

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-925" src="https://jordansjourney.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/4431356246_a1cd7904d3_o.jpg" alt="Jordan Casts" width="800" height="533" />

But one project stands out from the rest because it actually helped us work through a cancer issue together. It was staged shortly after Jordan began radiation therapy.

In the photo below, you’ll notice purple lines on Jordan’s face. These were drawn by radiation technicians. They ensured that Jordan's body was perfectly aligned on the equipment. The radiation beam had to hit a precise spot in order to be effective.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-926" src="https://jordansjourney.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/20110212_misc_117.jpg" alt="Jordan Pre Radiation" width="800" height="531" />

At first, Jordan thought it was hysterical that someone would write on her face. That is, until she learned that the lines had to stay there for 40 days of treatment. Then, she was devastated—despondent at the thought of going to middle school and facing her classmates with these strange and unflattering markings.

That’s when I suggested <a href="http://jordanvincent.com/2011/02/07/marked-up/" target="_blank">the War Paint Session</a>. I told her we should do some portraits, but rather than hide the markings we should make more. She was going to war against the tumor. And like all the great tribal warriors around the world, she needed to paint her face for the battle. With the help of some very generous partners (a makeup artist, hair stylist, and studio owner) we captured the images below. This was therapy through photography. Jordan felt beautiful and strong. It was a day I will never forget.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-938" src="https://jordansjourney.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/lmv_4366_2.jpg" alt="Jordan in War Paint" width="576" height="720" />

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-928" src="https://jordansjourney.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/20110219_warpaint_02_11x14_250dpi.jpg" alt="20110219_WarPaint_02_11x14_250dpi" width="800" height="629" />

Jordan’s participation in Shutterbugs delivered the greatest gift of photography on our journey. It empowered her. So much of Jordan’s experience with cancer has been the exact opposite. She cannot control what is unfolding in her body. She certainly couldn’t control all the treatment decisions we have made for her, nor the actions of her care teams. Childhood cancer can easily disempower children.

But Shutterbugs gave Jordan one thing that she could completely control: the images that she captured through photography. She received a camera and got assigned a mentor—Kate—who taught her valuable lessons on light and shadow, perspective and color. You see, Jordan didn’t just receive a great tool. She received insight and instruction. She learned how to use her camera to express herself and show the world what she imagined in her mind’s eye.

As <a href="http://jordanvincent.com/2011/05/14/the-artist-speaks/" target="_blank">I wrote in 2011</a>, when the program came to an end Jordan’s work was featured in a gallery show in Culver City. Two of her prints were displayed for the public. She walked joyfully down a red carpet, granted interviews with the press about her work, and relished a special day where she wasn’t celebrated as a cancer fighter, but instead as a creator.
<blockquote>Altering life by holding it still.</blockquote>
We can never know what the future holds. Photography has altered our life by helping us savor the preciousness of each new day. It has encouraged us to reflect on moments in time that delivered us today. And it has enabled Jordan to develop her own creative voice—to express herself on her terms—through the power of the shutter and the truth of the lens.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I misjudge the strength required and lift her onto my back indelicately. Her chest lands with a thud, and she exhales forcefully into my left ear.

“Sorry about that, J.”

“No problem, Dad. It didn’t hurt at all.”

She adjusts balance on my back, and I reach behind to lock my hands under her rump for support. We use this piggy-back position when we are going short distances and wish to leave the wheelchair behind. It’s easier on everyone and I think Jordan likes traveling this way. To be honest, I like it, too.<!--more-->

“Looks like there’s a monkey on my back,” I say to her.

She giggles.

We call this carrying position The Hodor, after the character in <em>Game of Thrones</em> who carries the crippled Bran Stark around the Seven Kingdoms. We have two other carrying positions. We use Koala for climbing stairs or short standing periods. Jordan rests on one of my hip bones and holds on to me with all fours, just like a koala bear hugging a tree.

The third position she calls “Bride” which is, as it sounds, the threshold carry: her lying horizontal in my outstretched arms. We don’t use this mode of transport much because it’s awkward to move very far and it’s rough on my back. But it is sometimes necessary when I need to scoop her up from a bed or a chair in a hurry, like when she’s feeling sick from a seizure episode.

I imagine many people wonder why I enter a restaurant carrying a tall and lanky 17 year-old girl on my back. But once I set her down to use her legs for the last few yards, it’s obvious. In any event, I’m the only one who’s self-conscious. Jordan thinks it’s cool. She smiles radiantly and tells people that she’s my “little monkey.”

I love these moments with Jordan and I sometimes get sad thinking about a day when it may no longer be possible for her to hop on my back and skip the wheelchair. It’s one of the reasons I'm on a mission to stay in shape, and why I'm careful to mind my back. I love hearing her breathe behind me. Sometimes, she exhales in unison with my steps. And when she’s that close, she often half-whispers into my ear so that even in a big public space we have our own intimate conversations that make the world feel smaller.

Last week, during the super blood red moon, Jordan and I used the Hodor mount to walk up and down the block in search of the astronomical oddity. Sadly, the clouds prevented us from seeing. But she and I chatted idly as we wandered along the sidewalk gazing eastward. It was a very warm night, but there was a breeze coming in from the ocean and I didn’t mind keeping her on my back for such an extended time. I fancied our piggy-back expedition as a long walk with a reverse hug. These moments are precious to me. They are part of the immense gratitude I feel for every day with Jordan.

For 17 years, she’s been my little girl but it has suddenly dawned on Jeanette and I that Jordan will be a legal adult next year. This milestone will make life more complicated. Once she’s 18, she must provide consent for us to be involved in her medical affairs and her care. Otherwise, we have no say.

For the more than 12 years that she has been fighting cancer, I have often felt the pressure of having to make decisions for Jordan. We’ve authorized countless surgeries, radiation, and toxic treatments that themselves are carcinogenic. We always included Jordan in the decision-making, even when she was very young. It is her body and we believed that she always had a right to participate. But back then, she had little power to change the course of action if she strongly objected. Jeanette and I had the final say (although I’m happy to say that we never had an instance of opposing views on what to do next). Next year, the tables reverse. We will be her counselors and the final decision will ultimately be Jordan’s to choose.

We will be hiring a lawyer soon to help us sort out many issues as Jordan becomes a legal adult—everything from enabling us to help her make the best decisions in her health care to helping her develop a living will so that she has more control over what happens to her should she ever wind up back in a critical situation. We have always wanted Jordan to be independent; to feel a sense of pride and achievement in her life. So these matters are wrought with a lot of gravity. And, I suppose it is why I feel even more pleasure when I have the opportunity to hoist my little monkey on my back and carry her around for awhile.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We had to push the cart uphill. The nearest handicap space at our local market sat atop a slight incline. As we approached it, I asked Jordan if she wanted me to take over.

“No, Dad. I can do it,” she said.

And she did.<!--more-->

As she heaved the cart and navigated a few curbs and obstacles I placed my hand on her back for support. Beneath her well-worn purple hoodie, I could feel a network of miraculously strong muscles working to will herself up the hill. While her narrow, emaciated legs flopped forward and clumbered on and off a semi-straight line, her core was drawn in and engaged. She used her arms to provide stability, hanging onto the cart’s handle. And she made it to the car on her own to deliver our culinary payload.

This is Jordan at work. She humbles me with her quiet, extraordinary strength—a strength that propels her through otherwise ordinary days.

This trip was her idea. We decided to bake cookies for some friends this holiday season. When I noted that we needed supplies, Jordan begged me to take her along to the market. My first inclination was to say no. When she tags along a 10-minute trip can become an hour. But she loves going to the market, in large part because she uses the cart as a kind of walker. She is far more mobile pushing groceries than she is wandering around our house.

Jordan spends a lot of time in her wheelchair. It’s custom-made, just for her. And she appreciates all that she can do in the chair, but she’d much rather be on her feet. Unfortunately, her legs and her feet have grown weaker and weaker. She is not able to stand for very long. She has poor balance. And, walking is rife with serious risk. <a href="http://jordanvincent.com/2012/04/26/tripped-up/" target="_blank">Four years ago</a>, she ended up in the hospital for several weeks after she missed a step and hit her head during a bad fall.

Today, Jordan needs to have someone supporting her every step that she's out of the chair. It's either that, or she crawls on her hands and knees.

This is perhaps why the market offers so much magic for her. While she’s pushing the cart she needs us less and she can use her own two feet to go where she wants. This allure is precisely why I decided it was a good idea for her to come shopping with me. But I didn’t expect her to take the hill. The girl never ceases to surprise me. She so often makes me have nothing else to say other than, “damn!"

2015 has been a mostly uneventful year for Jordan. The tumors are stable. She has weaned off of some of the troublesome anti-seizure medications and her seizures have become less severe, though still fairly routine. But the really good news is that 2015 was a year without hospital stays. No surgeries. No weeks away from home.

That’s about to change.

Jordan is scheduled for orthopedic surgery in January. The doctors will try again to reshape her feet and give her more opportunities to be out of the wheelchair.

I’ve been living in denial.

I hate the thought of this surgery. While it is far less risky than the brain and spinal surgeries she has endured, the last time she had orthopedic surgery she experienced so much pain. As counterintuitive as it may sound, the pain experienced in recovery from her brain and spinal surgeries was very brief and manageable. In contrast, the orthopedic surgery was rough and the recovery went on for weeks. To make matters worse, she will be pretty much immobile. Both of her feet will be in casts for 12 weeks—6 weeks in non-weight-bearing casts, then 6 that will allow her to start walking again.

When she had this surgery the last time, <a href="http://jordanvincent.com/2010/02/27/mrs-dubose/">the hardest part was getting her to stay still</a>. She wanted to move and every time she crawled around she elevated her pain. But there was no holding her back. It was the same spirit as the girl who chose to push the cart uphill at the market. She craves independence. She welcomes every opportunity to prove that she is strong.

And to be honest, I wouldn’t have it any other way.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today is the last day of January; the end of the first month of 2016. I am certain that there are plenty of people feeling guilty today because they have already neglected their New Year’s resolutions. It’s an easy fault. We start a year with hope and intention but lose our way on diligence and follow-through. This week, Jordan diligently followed-through on her intention to have surgery on her feet; an act of courage dedicated to the hope she has to walk more and use the wheelchair less.

The surgery went well, especially compared to the similar procedure Jordan endured five years ago. Back then, she suffered for several days in excruciating pain. While this surgery was equally invasive and potentially painful, the team relied upon an innovative pain management protocol that has kept Jordan relatively comfortable. Although “relatively” is open to interpretation.

My girl’s resolve humbles and inspires me. We gave her every opportunity to delay or bow out of this surgery. We told her this was her decision. Candidly, I confided that I didn’t want her to do it. I didn’t want her to suffer again. But she was committed. Watching her in pre-op, relaxing as best she could whilst nurses and doctors prepared her body for four hours of surgery—it made my heart swell. If she had an ounce of fear, you would be hard-pressed to sense it. Of course, I’m sure she was afraid. She’d done this before. Courage, as they say, is not letting the fear stop you.

Friday night, after we read a chapter from <i>Emma</i> together, I commended her on her strength. She was lounging in her bed with her plaster-cast feet propped on pillows.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is raw. Prudence has been ignored. I need to write because I have nowhere else, at the moment, to release.

One moment, she was chatting with me. The next, she was convulsing, spasming, vomiting. Demons possessed her body. She fought to regain control. At times, she would sit straight up and wrestle with us. Then she would succumb; allowing her body to writhe and jerk, vibrate and seize.

This is not new. But we haven't seen it so severe for awhile. Even after witnessing it many times, it still haunts me; converts my mood to a bluer shade.

I was in the kitchen with Jeanette when it happened. I heard the first whimper. It was soft, but I knew. She was calling for her mother.

"Mom, where are you? I need you."

She was repeating this phrase over and over. By the time we rounded the corner the seizure was setting in full and she shrieked a last frightened, "Mom!"

All we could do was sit near her, stroking her hair and reminding her quietly that she was not alone and that she was safe. Ten minutes passed as the storm surged through her body. Waves of it thundered over her.

Later, after she could speak again, I carried her up to her room. We agreed no book reading tonight. Too much for her mind to process. I asked her if she knew what had happened. She said, "well, sometimes you just get tired."

"That's all," I asked.

"Yes. Sometimes you just get tired."

She has no memory of her possession. But I do.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I wrote this for Jordan the night before she started a burst of seizures. She was scheduled to travel to CHLA for blood work and a port flush. I couldn't join her. I made a little card and left it on the dining table for her. Jeanette told me Jordan loved it, and wanted to call me to tell me so just seconds before the first seizure hit.

She doesn't remember any of it. But I post this for her to stumble upon some day again. I still wish all of these intentions true.

<hr />

When you get bored,
think of the color green,
and a blanket of grass
on a summer scene.

When you get scared,
think of the color blue,
and a swimming pool
with a raft for me and you.

When you get sad,
think of the color pink,
like a lemonade
you might like to drink.

When you get cross,
think of the color purple,
and all your dear friends
gathered round in a circle.

And when you get tired
think of the color red,
like a blushing rose,
or my heart, instead.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Little Buddy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I like to think of the port catheter as Jordan’s Little Buddy. Almost an imaginary friend, because it cannot be seen so easily; just a subtle dimple on her chest. But it goes wherever she goes, underneath her skin, close to her heart, ready to serve.

Little Buddy became part of Jordan’s life in 2005 <a href="https://jordanvincent.com/2005/08/24/continuing-resolution/" target="_blank">when she began IV chemotherapy</a>. She was seven years old then. Little Buddy was an unfortunate birthday present. Jordan began having strong seizures on the actual day of her seventh birthday. She ended up in the hospital for a week thereafter. That’s when the doctors decided it was time to get more aggressive in the fight with the tumors, and Little Buddy found a home.

Eleven years later, it amuses Jeanette and I whenever Jordan needs to be connected to an IV. The nurses are always surprised about how small a needle is required. Our seventeen year-old young lady has a child-size port. That’s the moment when they realize how long she’s been in her battle with cancer. And they are usually amazed that the port has never had to be replaced.

Well ... Little Buddy stopped working a few months ago. It is now time to say goodbye. And he will not be replaced. The latest MRI indicates that Jordan’s tumors are stable. They have not changed in size or shape for the last four years; which means that there’s really no need for Jordan to have a port anymore. It’s one more step towards a normal life. One that we hope persists forever.

In a couple of weeks, Jordan will go in for surgery. Removing a port is a pretty routine procedure, except with Jordan nothing is ever routine. Because Little Buddy has been in her body for so long, there is a chance that a lot of tissue has bound him close to her. They’ve literally grown together. While there is not great risk involved, it may require a little more work than usual. But Jordan is happy about their separation, and unbothered by the reality of another surgery.

Speaking of surgery, her legs are healing well and she grows stronger every day. She recently transitioned to walking casts. For the first few days, every step was painful and stiff. But now she’s powering along with an impressive gait. We have every reason to believe that the surgery on her feet will greatly improve her long-term mobility. The proof will unfold when she begins physical therapy about a month from now. That’s when the real work begins.

Her spirit is delightful these days. Grace is a word I often use to describe my daughter. She has managed every twist and turn of this year in good humor and with abundant courage. I am so proud of her. And I think she is proud of herself. Throughout her journey she has longed for more control and independence in her life. Each time she overcomes an obstacle she proves to herself that she has both—that control and independence are a state of mind. The decisions she has made about her own body this year have proven to be great liberators. She has powered through and thrived and impressed us all in her resolve.

And she did it all without any help from Little Buddy. So it’s time for him to go.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As I was going upstairs I heard the bathroom door close and then a thud.

I called out calmly to see if Jordan was ok. Usually I get a quick, "everything’s fine, Dad." Not today.<!--more-->

I heard another thud against the door.

My second call was unanswered. So, I tried to open the door.&nbsp;

It wouldn’t budge because her weight was against it. I turned the handle and gently pushed. I could feel her seizing body pressing back on the other side.&nbsp;

My heart was racing.&nbsp;

How could I get in there and keep her safe without hurting her?&nbsp;

I kept talking to her, urging her to move away from the door, but knowing that she was unable to understand me while she was in the throes of a seizure.

She finally moved enough for me to get the door open about 8 inches. I spied her trying to stand. On the counter was her toothbrush and a tube of paste that she had just opened. Water was running in the sink.

My new challenge was to encourage her to keep moving while discouraging her from standing. By the time I got into the bathroom she was on one knee and pushing upward with her&nbsp;other foot. She struggled for&nbsp;balance as&nbsp;her body shook violently. Her mouth convulsed and made sucking sounds. Her eyes raced to every corner of the room, shifting and searching, setting loose without a target.

I grabbed her around the waist, scooped up her legs and carried her to her bedroom. She shook and squirmed but managed to wrap her arms around my neck.

Jeanette heard the commotion and raced into the room clad in a bath towel. Together, we laid Jordan down and calmly reminded her that she was safe now. Jeanette stroked her hair and coaxed her back with soft, gentle questions. Slowly, Jordan returned. But on her forehead a distinct series of red welts surfaced. It took a moment for me to process, but then I realized that she must have hit her head. I ran downstairs and got ice, wrapped it in a towel, and ran back to apply it, hoping to&nbsp;prevent swelling.

Jordan re-emerged from the haze of seizure. She looked troubled, confused, tired. She could speak again, but she didn’t feel like talking. She rolled on to her side and closed her eyes. We asked if anything hurt. We asked if she had a headache. Concussions railed in our mind. She twice told us that she felt no pain. We explained that she had had a seizure and that we were sure she hit her head. We told her not to be afraid to tell us if she felt pain or nausea.

She’s going to be seeing the doctor later today.

We live in a weird state of normal. Occasionally, on days like today, we are reminded that Jordan’s life is anything but. I haven’t felt afraid on Jordan’s Journey in a long time. But today I felt it when I could not get to her and when I knew she was in danger. The panicked feeling of helplessness lingers.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[“They’re sure going to be excited,” she says.

“Who?” I ask.

“My friends at school.”

She is fishing. She loves to lure me in with a vague statement that begs a question. I take the bait.

“Why do you think they’re going to be excited?”

“To see me walking.”

And then it dawns on me. She was absent much of the last school year due to surgery on her legs and then a lengthy recovery. The school thought it best for her to take lessons at home rather than risk injury when both her legs were immobile in non-walking casts. By the time she was up on her legs again the school year was over.

So, she’s absolutely right. I bet her friends and her teachers will be excited. If their reaction to her progress is anything like ours, they will be astonished.

This afternoon, Jordan and I had brunch together. We walked to a restaurant a couple of blocks away. The girl moves purposefully; swiftly. Before surgery, a walk like this one would have been so laborious it would have been impractical. Today, it was just another walk. In the past, I would have had to hold on to her gait belt and steady her on many near stumbles and falls. Today, holding her hand lightly was more than enough support. She has better balance, better movement, a better life.

Last night, as she draped her legs over the arm of the couch in perfect teenage form, I spied the bottoms of her feet. They were once scrawny—skin too close to bone, completely absent of muscle. Doctors liberally used the word “deformed.” Now her feet are plump and full of flesh. They have plenty of battle scars, but they look healthy.

She is rightfully proud of her progress. A cheshire grin stretches across her face whenever someone compliments her. She imagines all the things she will do now that she has her legs back. Her new goal is to ride a bike.

She will turn 18 in less than two weeks. As much as it shocks me that she will no longer be a child in the eyes of the law, I have to admit that she has been deftly straddling the threshold of adulthood for several years now. While in some ways she is preserved in a childlike state of relentless hope and optimism, she rules her life with more strength and determination than most adults I know.

This reality has been on my mind as I have weathered through a rough couple of months. I’ve been a moody and irritating presence to my colleagues, family and friends—prone to feeling sorry for myself and feeling defeated. When I claw out of this pathetic haze it is usually after spending time with Jordan.

I am in awe of her.

She is walking again.

To be completely honest, I had resigned myself to the possibility that she might rely on the wheelchair for the rest of her life. But Jordan had other plans and she did not allow herself to get lost in self pity. She led us to a drive with new doctors and a new outlook on her case. She insisted upon the surgery—even when Jeanette and I were not sure it was a good idea and doctors advised that it would be painful. She patiently persevered through a lengthy and tedious recovery. She never shied away from the really hard work of rehab. And she has taken every chance to use her legs because she knows the more she walks, the more she walks.

Of course her friends at school are going to be excited. If they aren’t, she'll be sure to go fishing again and lead them to the reason why they should be. It is much more important, however, that she is excited by her accomplishments and her potential. Fortunately for me, her excitement is infectious and the example she sets is instructive.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In a novel, not a song, Leonard Cohen wrote “children show scars like medals. Lovers use them as secrets to reveal. A scar is what happens when the word is made flesh.”

Yesterday, The Slayer crossed the threshold from childhood to adulthood. She celebrated her 18th birthday. While there is much about her that retains the wonder and innocence of a child, she bears the scars of a fighter, a survivor, a conqueror. These are literal scars, not wounds of words. Though one word is the root of every wound: cancer.

[gallery columns="2" link="none" type="square" size="medium" ids="1083,1082,1081"]

Jordan is my second child to enter the realm of adulthood. When Lucas turned 18 I waxed sentimental about his future. When he became a man it was impossible not to project myself onto the roads he would travel—to live in the promise of his potential. I suspect this annoyed him. His journey was his own and I imagine he wished it unencumbered by the idealistic meanderings of a tireless adolescent.

For Jordan it is different. As she asserts herself as a promising young woman I can only focus on the past—what she has overcome, where we have been. Fourteen years of uncertainty have taught me to temper cravings for tomorrow and relish the delicious delicacies of today. I linger over the history of her resilience and her unwavering sense of purpose. It's not hard to do. Time has carved a record into her body. We can point to a scar and know precisely what she conquered and when. But forward is her only mode of thought. Last night at her birthday dinner she planned a brunch for us today. And then at our brunch she planned an outing a week ahead. There is always something new to do, always some new goal to work towards. Last year it was the desire to walk again. Now, it is learning to cook, to speak in sign language, to ride a bike.

Her scars are neither medals nor secrets. While one could claim they are a word made flesh, these etchings have more meaning to me than they do to her. To her, they are merely the consequence of a moment in time that can't be lived again. So, why bother dwelling on them? She’s moved on. Tomorrow is unblemished.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have been on a history kick. My latest fixation is the period of time between the first and second world wars. All the characters of that era fascinate me—Churchill, FDR, Patton—but I have lately been drawn to Eleanor Roosevelt more than anyone else. She became a strong leader and advocate despite her insecurities and despite many setbacks. These two quotes say it all:
<blockquote>We do not have to become heroes overnight. Just a step at a time, meeting each thing that comes up, seeing it as not as dreadful as it appears, discovering that we have the strength to stare it down.</blockquote>
And,
<blockquote>You gain strength, courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You are able to say to yourself, “I have lived through this horror. I can take the next thing that comes along.” You must do the thing you think you cannot do.</blockquote>
Yesterday, I saw these principles in action when Jordan mounted a bike at SoulCycle and rode with a pack of friends, colleagues and family who came to show their support for <a href="http://www.alexslemonade.org/mypage/1268639/member/26502" target="_blank">Alex’s Lemonade Stand Foundation</a> (ALSF), for Jordan, and for all children living with cancer. She made it through the entire ride and she’s still beaming.

To understand the context of this day you have to go back a year with me. About this time last year, we worked with SoulCycle and the UTA Foundation to organize a fundraising ride to benefit ALSF, for which Jordan is a hero ambassador. While we road in the car to the event, I coached Jordan on what to say to the riders. She doesn't love speaking, but we wanted her to have a role since she couldn't join the ride. Her legs were not strong enough. They were terribly thin and her feet suffered from sores that would not close, sparking fears from her doctors of a possible bone infection.

“Try it again,” I said.

“Let’s kick cancer’s butt together,” she replied.

“Excellent!”

A few minutes before the ride got started, Jordan wheeled into the studio, nailed her speech, smiled softly and then made her exit. She waited in the lobby as our pack rode hard with instructor Chris Layda. She was really unhappy about being left out, but when the pack congregated afterward she joined them in a round of lemonade and she smiled charmingly from her chair in the group photo.

Our drive home was mostly quiet, with me filling the gaps with exclamations about how much fun I'd had. That's when Jordan weighed in.

“Next year, I want to ride,” she said.

Jeanette and I exchanged glances, then I counseled Jordan to manage her expectations. I told her it was possible she might do a full SoulCycle ride someday, but she might not want to set her hopes too high. As I have written here before, Jeanette and I were both resigning ourselves to the idea that Jordan might spend the rest of her life on wheels. Jordan had another idea.

“I think I can do it, Dad,” she asserted. “It would be cool to do that ride with you.”

If you’ve been <a href="http://jordanvincent.com/2016/08/07/following-her-footsteps/">following along with us</a>, you know what happens next. Jordan elected to have surgery earlier this year that has produced stunning results. The wheelchair is collecting dust in our hall closet. And Jordan achieved her goal of riding a full class with our group yesterday, not two weeks after she bravely (and somewhat easily) checked off another goal by walking a mile and a half at another fundraiser.

Yet that is not the whole of this story. This is not just another testament to the resilience of my cancer slayer. Eleanor Roosevelt’s words have manifest all around me. During our fundraising campaign this year, so many people reached out to tell me their own personal cancer stories. Each touched and inspired me, and in each instance the person told me they wanted to share because they were touched and inspired by Jordan’s accomplishments. As Eleanor said, “you gain strength, courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face.” For many of  these fellow fighters and supporters, sharing their story took courage and allowed them to look fear in the face, even for a moment. That fact makes me want to do more.

It's no secret. I am a SoulCycle fanatic. I ride five times a week. I feel so much a part of this community, having made new friends and developed relationships with several of the instructors. Yesterday’s event happened at a poetic place for Jordan’s latest milestone. Both of us have gained strength, courage and confidence because of SoulCycle.

“You must do the thing you think you cannot do.”

We don’t have to do these “things” alone. In fact, I have often said that while our family has felt many things on Jordan’s Journey with cancer, we have never felt alone. This was especially true yesterday. The room was packed. The energy was off the charts. And three very special people had an impact on my experience—Jennifer Goodwin, Alba Verela and Laura Crago.

[caption id="attachment_1113" align="alignnone" width="1200"]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1113" src="https://jordansjourney.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/20160924_misc_013.jpg" alt="20160924_misc_013" width="1200" height="1199" /> Me with rockstar instructors Alba Verela and Laura Crago after the ride.[/caption]

I met Jennifer by riding next to her every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday in the front row of the Santa Monica “rooster” classes. She’s an intense athlete and, to be honest, I was intimidated by her for the longest time. It wasn’t until a day in class when instructor Molly Schreiber referenced <a href="http://jordanvincent.com/2015/05/03/the-slayers-ride/">the awesome ride that she staged for Jordan</a> last year, that Jennifer introduced herself. "That was you!" she said. From that moment on, we became Soul Buddies. I quickly learned that she has struggled with her own health issues, and reading <a href="http://higherhealth.net/blog" target="_blank">her blog</a> is a testament to Eleanor Roosevelt’s advice. Jennifer has the strength to stare anything down. She’s a true inspiration and having her to my left as we rode with Jordan gave me so much strength, courage and confidence.

To my right, was Alba Verela, a SoulCycle instructor that I ride with at least once a week. Alba’s energy is infectious. Even though she was not the instructor for the charity ride, and despite the fact that she had already taught two classes that day, she showed up on a beautiful Saturday afternoon and motivated me to push even harder. It isn’t every day that you get to ride shoulder-to-shoulder with one of your fitness heroes. Alba is more than that. She’s a dedicated mom, a friend, and a beautiful soul. It meant the world to me to have her there.

And then, there’s Laura Crago. I’ve logged almost 400 rides at SoulCycle, and about a quarter of them have been with this rockstar. I first learned about her from another instructor, who told our class about <a href="https://www.soul-cycle.com/community/inspiration/lauras-inspiring-journey/1233/" target="_blank">Laura’s inspiring ride across America in 2015</a>—from the Santa Monica Pier to the Brooklyn Bridge … on her own. When I heard about that, I immediately thought, “I have to ride with her.” And I did. That first ride did not disappoint. I’ve been riding with her every week since.

[caption id="attachment_1116" align="alignnone" width="1200"]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1116" src="https://jordansjourney.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/20160924_misc_006_b.jpg" alt="20160924_misc_006_b" width="1200" height="1199" /> Jordan and SoulCycle instructor Laura Crago[/caption]

Laura was the perfect match for Jordan’s ride yesterday. The spirit that propelled Laura to cross over 3,000 miles on a bike is the same spirit that lifted Jordan from the wheelchair to the saddle. Earlier this year, Laura injured her back and for several weeks she was unable to ride the podium in her classes. She taught from the floor and many of those rides—when all we had to guide us was her voice, her dedication and her passion—were the most powerful, challenging and rewarding rides I have ever experienced.

Shortly after we announced our ALSF SoulCycle ride, Laura began promoting it in her class. She didn’t know who would be teaching and neither did I, though I had requested her. Nevertheless, she told our classes that she was coming and that she would ride with us regardless of who was teaching. I was thrilled when we got word that she would lead the pack!

From the beginning of the ride, she reminded riders that they could do anything they set their minds to, just like Jordan. She challenged us to give just a little more than we thought we could that day to ride in solidarity with the more than 700 kids who begin their journey with cancer every single day. And, she weaved Britney Spears and KT Tunstall into the playlist, knowing that they are two of The Slayer’s favorite singers (Jordan sang along).

I saw two warriors bond yesterday, I rode with 50 more, and I left the event on an emotional high that I’m still savoring the day after. And Jordan is already talking about her next ride and wanting to try some dance moves.

“We do not have to become heroes overnight. Just a step at a time.” I am so grateful to be surrounded by so many people who have supported Jordan and our family on the many steps of her journey. Not only do I not feel alone, I feel blessed. And my daughter thrives from an abundance of heroes—fellow warriors, inspiring role models, and generous souls. That is why she does the things she might otherwise think she cannot do.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[She refused to look at me. I walked into the bedroom around noon on Wednesday. I had hoped to be with Jordan when she watched the DVR of Hillary Clinton’s concession speech. She had been asleep when the shocking news streamed through that Donald Trump was our new President. I had meetings in the morning. I hoped by the time I got home Jeanette and I could break the news to Jordan together. Instead, I caught her midway through Secretary Clinton’s speech. Jordan was visibly upset.

This was her first time voting. She and I worked together for several days before the election, going through all the initiatives and candidates. She wanted to know a lot about everything that would require her vote. The night before election day, we marked up her sample ballot together. And then on election day we stood in line together and then we went to the voting booth together. I regret that we didn't experience the loss together. Maybe a small part of me is relieved. Jeanette and I were distraught in the early hours of that morning when we heard the news as it happened. I'm not sure we would have been good supports for Jordan then. Now, was probably better.

Back in the voting booth after Jordan cast her vote for President I patted her on the back and said, “you just voted for the President of the United States.” She shushed me and told me she was trying to concentrate. This was her resolve. Voting had so much meaning for her. And she was wholeheartedly behind Hillary. I have to say that her spirit motivated me.

I was heartbroken watching her learn that her candidate had lost. Later that day she watched President Obama ask Americans to support President Elect Trump. Jordan stood up forcefully and started to storm out of the room. I stopped her.

“Honey, he’s doing the right thing. This is how we work in the United States. Donald Trump won and President Obama is reminding Americans to respect the office and support the next leader of our country.”

She looked me in the eyes and said, “I know, Dad. But that doesn’t mean I have to sit here and listen to it. I want to be alone.”

Such was our week. The episode, in some ways, reflects the state of our journey.

Jordan has experienced some setbacks in life. There are days when her balance is off. She stumbles around the house before tripping into a bit of despair.

“Why don’t I have my balance?” she asks.

“It’s just not cooperating today,” I’ll say. But, of course, I don’t know why some days she walks with great confidence and on other days she steps tentatively with arms outstretched for the next solid object.

Then, there are the seizures. They spike here and then. Earlier this week she had three full seizures in the span of 2 days. While she doesn’t remember much about them, she gets frustrated that she’s having seizures at all.

A few months ago it seemed we had made so much progress this year. We reveled in her accomplishments. She walked over a mile and participated in a SoulCycle ride. Her legs plumped back up with muscle. She was back to school and the wheelchair was in the closet.

Now, we have hit a plateau. She has missed so much school due to seizures and fatigue that she’s been assigned a home school teacher. She was not happy about this, but it was necessary. She gets headaches, has a pesky cough that surges to the point of nausea when she feels a seizure coming, and she experiences disruptive nerve spasms that animate her body against her will, leading her to sometimes consider her body an enemy combatant.

We’re not taking it lightly. We stepped up the scheduling of her next MRI, if for no other reason than to rule out tumor progression as a cause and help all of us breathe (and sleep) easier.

I’ve spent a lot of time with Jordan over the past few days. Despite my own disappointment over the election outcome, I’ve counseled her to see it for what it is: an outcome, but not an ending. It needn’t determine our fate. Instead, it should motivate us to take action and participate. It’s no different from the way we fight cancer. There’s a lot we can’t control, so we focus on the things we can. We paint a picture in our mind of the way we want things to be and we do all that we can to make that picture a reality, recognizing that paint will run and the light will change. I’m not always sure how much she understands or believes this. Sometimes, I worry that she believes it too much. No matter. As long as we stick together and retain hope we’ll be okay. Of this, I’m entirely confident.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I knew in an instant that something was wrong. Ordinarily, when I enter the living room after a long day of work I am greeted by Jordan with a buoyant “oh, hey, Dad!” It is followed by a stream-of-consciousness recounting of her day’s events so dizzying that Jeanette intercedes, scolding Jordan to “wait and let Dad put his things down.” It is this way most evenings. But not tonight.

Jordan reclines on our couch, resting her head in the corner where the arm meets its back. She wears purple print pajamas with green trim. Her hair curls and swirls around her head in a mussed pattern that hints it may have been brushed earlier in the day, but the day is over. I start the conversation.

“Hey, Jordan.”

“Hey”

“How was physical therapy?”

And then the revelation. She does not answer me. Instead, she lifts her left leg and flexes her foot. That’s when I see it—the blood blister swelling near the ball. It is the size of an over-ripe strawberry but dull plum in color.

Jeanette interjects.

“They weren’t able to do her normal PT today. In fact, her therapist wants us to keep her off her feet and schedule an appointment with the orthopedist as soon as we can.”

I stare deeply into Jordan’s eyes. She looks down and away and then back at me and then off to a spot somewhere else in the room. I recognize this avian behavior as the defense mechanism she summons when emotion rushes over; when she is confused, when she wants to find distance instead of listen to reason.

I look again at the damned knob trespassing on her sole. It is ugly and unwelcome and an unwarranted punishment for a year of hard work. After all, it was about this time in 2016 that Jordan chose surgery as a way to thwart these leeches on her mobility. The blood blisters robbed her of her freedom. They made it so painful for her to walk that she took to her hands and knees to move about the house, climb stairs and function. She would not be stopped, but she was disabled. She hated relying on a wheelchair to move about her life and she was determined to use her feet again.

2016 was a challenging year. After surgery, she persevered through 6 weeks of near immobility as her feet recovered in heavy casts. Then, she moved her stiff paws in mobile casts and learned to walk again. Jordan worked so hard and we rejoiced in the progress she made. The sticks that were once her legs became fleshy and muscular while the wheelchair grew dusty. She walked a mile at our annual ALSF fundraiser, then rode SoulCycle with a pack of supporters. Her legs moved confidently. It seemed there was nothing she couldn’t overcome and that energized us all.

But around the holidays something changed. She found it hard to keep her balance. Sometimes she fell. At first, we didn’t think anything of it, but then it became more frequent. Her physical therapist noticed it, too, during their sessions. When the wobbliness got more persistent, we told her medical team and we expedited an MRI to rule out the possibility of tumor progression. The MRI showed that the tumor was stable. No one had an answer for why Jordan suddenly found it harder to move on her feet the way she did so well during the summer.

Now, we have a blood red sign that shouts something really isn’t right.

There’s much to do: doctors to call, insurance companies to lobby, and rearranging of schedules and life to focus attention on this latest setback.

2017 is, in fact, 13 AD in our family (AD = “After Diagnosis”). After so many years, we know the drill. But so many years have also exacted their toll. It is hard not to grieve. What Jordan did last year required tremendous courage and hope. Today, we’re anxious and discouraged and switching to reserve tanks that are leaking and nearly empty.]]></content:encoded>

Jordan: What?

Jeanette: Did Gracie <em>somehow</em> start barking?

Jordan: No.

Me: Jordan, how was your day?

Jordan: Oh, it was good. But somehow when I was telling my aide about our photos, she thought they were really interesting.

Me: Which photos?

Jordan: The ones we took when we were playing with lights.

Me: Was it really unexpected that you brought this up? Did it just happen <em>somehow</em>?

Jordan: Yes.

Me: You told your aide this story by some means that was extraordinary or surprising?

Jordan: No.

Me: Care to try again?

Jordan: Ok.

Jordan: I felt very sad for this woman I met on our field trip.

Me: Why?

Jordan: She told me that a family member died because of cancer. I told her I know how she felt because I lost a grandpa and an uncle to cancer.

Me: That’s hard. Did you tell her about your cancer?

Jordan: Yes.

Me: What did you say?

Jordan: I told her that I had to deal with cancer, too. But <em>somehow</em> I survived.

Me: Yes. You did. Somehow.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you want to know the truth, we were both acting childish. Both of us were cross and unreasonable. Jordan flared up and then refused to talk to me, turning her head away to avoid eye contact. I was a cranky bully who was having a bad morning and didn’t really want to brunch. But brunch is our weekly ritual. Brunch is sacred … except when it isn’t. Except when she decides to sleep in.

Here’s how it goes most Saturday nights:

Jordan: Dad, what time should I set my alarm so we can go to brunch together tomorrow?

Me: The same as every week. 11am.

Jordan: Ok. I will get up this time.

But some weeks, when I get home from my weekly SoulCycle ride, she’s still snoozing away. When I try to wake her she’ll mumble, “I just want to sleep today, dad.”

And that’s perfectly fine with me. I love the time with her but I’m also more than happy to brunch by myself. And on the days when she actually does wake up, it is usually the most pleasant Dad and Daughter time imagineable—a wonderful way for both of us to end the week in good company, laughing and eating good food at one of our favorite Santa Monica eateries.

Not today.

Here’s what they never tell you about childhood cancer. They never tell you that if you’re lucky enough to keep it from killing your child you get to enjoy the effects of its aftermath.

The aftermath is the stray dog that won’t leave us alone. The aftermath is the conversation we never want to have because there’s no easy way to consider it. We should be grateful for the aftermath. And we are. But sometimes it also pushes us to edges. We live in a world of 24/7 care and concern. There are the seizures, and the risks of falling from troublesome mobility. There are bloody toes and sudden coughing spells. There are the constant headaches and bottles of pills in every corner. There are the struggles disassembling and then assembling the wheelchair again and again … and the planning required to do something as simple as Sunday brunch.

It takes a toll. It takes a toll on everyone including Jordan. We’ve been on this journey of tension and anxiety and constant call for fourteen years. A day of crossness and irritability is inevitable and minor in comparison, frankly.

Yet days like this cause me the most distress. They distress me because those edges that reveal themselves on a foggy Sunday morning are the ones that cut the sharpest.

It started out innocently. I came back from my ride half-expecting Jordan to still be asleep. She wasn’t. She was fully dressed and ready to go. She was also chatty. Before the front door had closed she was asking me questions and soliciting my help to find her sweater. She knows I hate being tasked when I first walk through the door, and Jeanette was quick to remind her to let me put my things down. But Jordan had a full head of steam going.

I’ll be honest. I was in a foul mood, and it had nothing to do with Jordan at all. I awoke envisioning this grand day, when I would get on the bike and crush it and then be so productive in my writing and other chores that my head would spin. Instead, I struggled on the bike and felt like the rest of my to-do list for the day was a prison sentence. Brunch felt like hard labor.

I showered, got dressed and walked Jordan to the car. We decided to drive because her balance was not great. When we arrived at the restaurant we sat at the counter, as we usually do, and I asked her what she wanted to order. Mind you, this is a restaurant that we go to nearly every Sunday when we brunch. She <em>knows</em> the menu. Still, she asked me to read it to her. The menu is double-sided. There are a lot of dishes. I asked for a general sense of what she wanted. She wanted me to read the options to her. So, this set me off.

We went back and forth about whether or not she wanted something breakfasty or something lunchy. I was an irritable old bastard about it. I can’t lie. But as I read through options she started to get sassy and things spiraled out from there leading to the exchange of silence and absence of eye contact that I mentioned above.

Now, you can look at all of this objectively and think it’s a perfectly normal “bad day” between a father and his teenage daughter. Except, what’s missing is the heaviness of minor things. What’s missing is the guilt I felt for not being more understanding of Jordan’s inability to navigate a menu on her own. What’s missing is the self-consciousness that I imagine Jordan sometimes feels by having to ask for help reading a menu—the feeling of dependence, perhaps even of being a burden.

She can't read a menu.

She can't go out on her own.

She can't go far from a bottle of anti-seizure medication.

She relies on us so that she can do normal things like go to brunch. Imagine how that must feel.

I never want her to feel she’s a burden. She is not. She is a gift. Our journey is the burden. Sometimes, it taxes each of us and makes us pretty miserable people. I do my best to don a Clark W Griswold smile, but sometimes the sum of it all takes over.

Fortunately, we find hope by realizing the misery doesn’t last. By the late afternoon, Jordan and I were lounging together in the living room. Jeanette was at yoga class. The sound system was playing jazz. The pets were snoring. I finished my writing. Jordan binged on TED talks. The room was otherwise still and peaceful. I broke that peace.

“Hey!” I said.

She looked up from her iPad.

“I was cranky earlier. It wasn’t your fault.”

“I understand,” she said. “I get sassy, too.”

And with that, we moved on, ready to take tomorrow.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[She didn’t bother to look up from her iPad when the doctor entered. He greeted her first. She acknowledged the greeting with a distracted “hey.” Five minutes later Jeanette and I needled Jordan to be present.

“Did you hear that, Jordan?” we’d say.

She intoned a “yeah” but seemed otherwise distracted. But she really wasn’t. I knew deep down that she was listening to every word. This was a defense mechanism. This was a clever way Jordan had devised to manage her health on her terms. Sometimes I worry that this detached and stoic front-face masks a scared and anxious child underneath. That child was forced to grow up quickly. That child believes that mom and dad want her to be strong; that the world wants her to treat her illness as a mere inconvenience when her natural instincts tug at her fears and insecurities.

We have been counseling Jordan to take more ownership of her health. In the months leading up to her 18th birthday last August, we reminded Jordan that she would soon be an adult in the eyes of the law. Because of that milestone, we wanted her to listen to doctors, to ask them questions, to direct them with her intentions. This campaign may seem noble on our part, but it was actually a harsh reality. For over a decade we have been the decision-makers. Jordan was a vested consultant, but the decisions were ours to make. After August 20th, the tables reversed. She had the power to call the shots. We could be cut out entirely, if she desired.

—

We are congregated in the office of Jordan’s therapist Robyn. Jeanette and I asked for the family meeting. Jordan adores Robyn. Robyn’s office has been a safe place for years—a place Jordan associates with fun and friendship. In fact, we refer to Robyn as Jordan’s “friend” not her “therapist.”

Family meetings are rare. Jeanette and I strive to make this time Jordan’s alone. This is for her to discuss whatever she wants, without an agenda. This is time for her to express what she feels down deep inside, without fear that Mom or Dad are listening.

This designation is somewhat arbitrary. Jordan has no secrets and I doubt that she would ever care if Robyn were to share their conversations with us. But we’ve always believed that this relationship is sacred and we take many pains to preserve it, respect it, cherish it. We don’t even ask Jordan what they discuss.

We requested the family meeting because Jordan needed to have surgery again and a cold fact stood before us: we (her parents) could not sign the consent forms. Jordan had to. We weren’t even entitled to a consultation with the physicians. The 18th year divide created such a shift in circumstance that the insurance company refused to discuss the case with us at all. Jordan is an adult. This life is now fully hers to drive.

Of course, Jordan is all too willing to have us take the wheel. But the process is tricky. For example, while trying to clear hurdles on the insurance front, Jeanette was instructed by the phone representative to put Jordan on the line in order to authorize the transfer of information. She did. The agent asked Jordan some identifying questions. When it came to her birthdate she bungled the year. She often confuses the last two digits, dyslexically flipping them. The agent asked her to clarify and Jeanette coached Jordan. At that point, the agent said, “ma’am, I can hear you in the background. I now have to terminate this call because we cannot release information when the patient might not be giving free consent.”

Jeanette went apoplectic. I did my best to calm her down and figure out a work-around. I’d had consent forms sitting in my inbox for months. My attorney provided them. One was consent for caregivers to release information about Jordan to us. The other was a power of attorney. I hated the idea of pulling this trigger. It was absolutely necessary, of course. Yet there was a part of me that hated the idea of asking Jordan to sign them. I want her to be independent. I wanted her to live a true adult life.

These papers don’t really take that away, but to me they admitted a kind of defeat. My conscience was heavy. Did Jordan know what she was signing? Was this what she wanted? How much influence were we exerting, even if we didn’t realize it?

As a stop gap, I had Jordan sign the information release form, but I did not want her to sign power of attorney without the family meeting with Robyn.

Back in the moment in Robyn’s office, Jordan is measured. After some fun initial small-talk, her tone shifted to that of the detached warrior in any other doctor’s office. She didn’t have an electronic device this time, but she had retreated to one word answers.

Robyn drew her out for a while. She had us all talk about the current situation. She asked Jeanette and I to explain what we thought needed to be done and then asked Jordan what she thought about it. We reminded Jordan of the time when she was in a coma. We told her about all the things that happened while she was away from us, like the time she had a seizure that lasted so long that she started having trouble breathing. The doctors asked us if we wanted them to help her breathe if it happened again. Or if we should let nature take over. Of course, we told them to help her breathe. We explained to Jordan that if that happened again, we would not have a say.

After a while, Robyn gave Jordan the option for Jeanette and I to leave the room so that Jordan and Robyn could discuss the matter privately. But Jordan didn’t think it was necessary. At that point, Robyn turned to us and said, “honestly, I think you may be over-thinking this.”

I looked up a little startled.

“Jordan trusts you very much,” she said. “We’ve talked about this a lot in the past. She knows that you fight for her and keep her safe. Don’t you, Jordan?”

Jordan nodded yes. Robyn told us about the many conversations they had in the past, in which Jordan confided to Robyn that she was very proud of us for always taking good care of her. How she felt safe. How she was grateful to have us as parents.

Now, it was my turn to be detached. I felt the urge to cry. I thought back to all the days in the past when I wished that someone else had the responsibility for making decisions to go forward with surgery or start an onerous chemotherapy protocol. I remembered the day that I kissed Jordan on the forehead before she was wheeled into spinal surgery. The risk in that surgery was palpable. There was a 50% chance she’d come back paralyzed from the waist down. The pit of my stomach ached with anxiety. Was I making the right decision? What regret would I feel if it didn’t go well and robbed Jordan of her quality of life? When those doors to the O.R. closed and she was out of sight I cracked. I think the technical term is that I lost my shit. I threw my arms around Jeanette and bawled, sobs escaping before I could catch my breath. That decision was the hardest one I’ve ever made in my life.

We ended our family meeting with Robyn with a strong sense of agreement: that Jordan would sign the documents that let her mom and dad make decisions for her with the doctors when needed.

That following weekend we visited a notary public. Jordan signed power of attorney to us in all matters related to her health. I can’t say that the moment gave me any comfort. While I was relieved that we could continue to represent Jordan’s best interests, I grieved that my daughter had to relinquish any part of her free will. She did so, however, with confidence and certitude.

Thursday, she had surgery on her left foot. But we did not need the power of attorney. Jordan wheeled herself into the check-in office on her own. She answered the nurse’s questions dutifully and signed the consent forms independently. She paid attention when the doctor arrived, and she made her opinions known when the anesthesia wore off and it was time to determine whether or not she was ready to go home. Her recovery has been remarkable. Her spirit and her resolve humble me and make me realize that Robyn was absolutely right. We were over-thinking it. From the very beginning, Jordan has always guided us. She only provided the illusion that the decisions were ours.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The words that came out of the nurse’s mouth rubbed me the wrong way. It wasn’t her fault and she didn’t mean any harm. That’s why I tried to shake it off and be present. Focus. Be upbeat for Jordan. But still, those words were gnawing inside.

“Is she mentally competent to answer our questions?”

We were seated in pre-op for Jordan’s latest MRI. It’s at a new hospital. Our 19 year-old slayer has outgrown CHLA, so this is a new crew who doesn’t know her. There were no familiar faces as we walked down the hall and we had a lot of history to share before we could proceed.

The question was innocuous, and the nurse had to ask it. That’s why I wasn’t annoyed with <em>her</em>. I was annoyed with the words. Perhaps, I was even more annoyed with how we answered.

Jeanette fumbled an attempt to say that Jordan assigned us power of attorney to help her manage her health care. She didn’t use those exact words and I could tell the nurse was a little puzzled. I wanted to say something that would refine this notion of "mental competence." All they had to do is have a conversation with Jordan and they would surely see that she is alert, and intelligent, and charming. But I reminded myself that that wasn’t really what the nurse meant. She wanted to know if Jordan could sign off on her own procedure; if she was capable of making decisions.

All this fuss was over the silliest of issues. Before Jordan could get into the MRI for a 2-hour brain and spine scan she had to assure the medical team that she was not pregnant. An MRI is harmful to a developing fetus. Ever since Jordan reached puberty, the team is required to make her take a pregnancy test. She usually gets offended. “Are you crazy, guys?” she asks with exasperation. At CHLA, she could usually have us sign a waiver, but this hospital was more strict. After a lot of back and forth, they got her to take the test and she was cleared for the MRI.

After 13 years of MRIs, you’d think this would be a routine emotional experience for all of us. And it is, somewhat. But there’s still an unsettling feeling in my stomach as I watch her drift off into sedation, with tubes and wires peeking out from her pajamas as she lies on a cold white table that will soon slide into a whirring metal oracle.

Will they find anything new? Is her cancer stable? Is there even the glimmer of hope that neurological progress is afoot?

This particular MRI was called ahead of schedule because Jordan has started having mobility issues again. She’s falling more and her balance is off. Her right leg is demonstrably weaker than her left leg. The orthopedics and physical therapy teams see no muscular reason for the setback, so the neurological folks want to have a look under the hood to see if there’s an explanation in the hidden recesses of her brain.

As usual, Jordan asked me to walk her into the procedure room. She wanted to hold my hand as they began sedation. Before she let them begin, she gave them all of her post-op instructions. They were not to use gauze with the band-aid that gets placed where the IV is. She doesn’t like how that feels. She wanted them to be sure to put the band-aid right-side up so that the cartoon figure was not upside down. It was essential that they keep Delilah (a beanie baby hippopotamus that has accompanied her on every MRI) close.

She gestured for me to lean over. She kissed me on the cheek and told me to tell her mom that she’d see her when she woke up. Then, with her usual grace, she closed her eyes and drifted off into assisted slumber.

Despite my annoyance at the discussion over Jordan’s competence, and the unfamiliarity of the new hospital, and the uncertainty over what challenge her body is giving us now, I am optimistic. We’ve come too far and my daughter’s spirit is too strong to let another mystery drag me into a funk. And on Saturday, I'll have about 50 reasons to feel good.

On Saturday, Jordan returns to SoulCycle for our third annual Slayer’s ride, which benefits Alex’s Lemonade Stand Foundation. Last year’s ride was full of so much emotion and joy. It was the first time Jordan got on a bike and joined the pack for a 45 minute fitness dance party. And she loved it. She’s excited to be doing it again. I remind myself of the power and symbolism of that ride. People coming together in solidarity with children living with cancer. Regardless of what we learn from today’s scan, we know that we won’t be alone. Meanwhile, we’re keeping our fingers crossed that there will be good reason to celebrate continued health on Jordan’s Journey.

If you would like to contribute to <a href="https://www.alexslemonade.org/mypage/1351611">our annual fundraising campaign</a>, here’s the link. 100% of your donation goes to Alex’s Lemonade Stand Foundation. ALSF is funding groundbreaking pediatric cancer research—research that I firmly believe is getting us closer and closer to cures.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When I closed my eyes I felt so much anger ... and frustration ... and defeat. It was the end of my yoga class and I was lying on my back. This is supposed to be the moment when serenity drifts over me; when I should feel centered again. Instead, I fought back the urge to scream.

I only recently returned to yoga. A few years ago, I practiced twice a week. Then, I stopped for reasons that escape me now. After a few weeks penned up in the apartment from Corona lock-down, it seemed like as good a time as any to return.

Last week, I joined my dear friend (and fitness muse) Pixie Acia's class. It didn't go as planned. I had the wrong mat and I didn't set out a towel or water. Frankly, I was a hot mess. This week, I got my act together. I prepped the living room properly. I had all my essentials at hand. And, I was feeling excited about stretching my body and gathering with the delightful crew of friends who Zoom around Pixie.

As soon as class began, Jordan asked to join me. My first instinct was to decline that request. She sprung it on me too late. We hadn't prepared for her. And if she joined me I would have to keep one eye on her to keep her safe. Yet, a voice in my head reminded me that Jordan wouldn't ask to join if it wasn't important to her—that she wanted to share the experience with me. So, we rushed to roll out her mat and she plopped down beside me.

It started well. She attempted many poses. Occasionally, I'd coach her to modify. Yet we found a rhythm and I found joy sharing this moment with Jordan.

Then, it was time for straps. And Jordan realized she didn't have one. I told her where her strap was but for some reason she fetched the elastic band Nettie uses for physical therapy. I was annoyed but then I thought, "if it works, so be it."

And then the snap.

Jordan stretched it too far and it burst into two flaccid halves.

Thus began our first miniature crisis.

I turned off the camera, checked to see if she was ok, scolded her for grabbing the wrong strap, found her the right one, and then encouraged her to follow along.

Camera back on, we resumed.

Then the seizure came.

"Dad, I'm going to throw up," she said.

We engaged in a small argument. She pleaded with me for a bucket while I insisted she take the pill from my outstretched hand and  put it under her tongue. I knew she wasn't going to throw up. The seizures make her feel nauseous. The nausea goes away when the meds kick in. Medicine first. Then the bucket, if needed. We didn't need it.

I don't remember if I turned the camera off during the scurrying and worrying. It's possible our scramble for Lorazepam was on full display for my yoga colleagues. It was then that the anger began to surface. I didn't mind that she wanted to join me but I resented the disruptions. This time—my time—was being invaded.

Jordan stopped trying the poses. She sat on her mat and watched me. Then she stared downward. As I moved through warrior pose I noticed that she was looking glum. I asked what was wrong.

"I broke Mom's strap," she said.

"Can we talk about this later?"

"I took it without permission. And I broke it," she replied.

"Jordan, it's ok. We'll get another strap."

"But it was her property," she said.

"Jordan, you wanted to join me for yoga. You're here now. Focus!"

I suggested she try child's pose.

I did my best to refocus. I haven't exercised much over the past few weeks and I could feel it, or the lack of it. Sweat drenched my neck. My muscles shook and wobbled. And I was breathing hard. I became aware that nothing in my body or mind was at peace. And that's when I noticed Jordan on her iPhone ... while still on-camera with me ... and the whole class. That's when I growled at her through the corner of my mouth.

"You're being rude. You can't just do your own thing. It's bad etiquette. It shows no respect for Pixie or for our friends who are trying to enjoy the session. If you want to play on your phone, go somewhere else!"

I said all of this, mind you, while trying to keep up with some pose that required us to twist our torso while our feet stretched and ... I forget. It was complicated and I was distracted.

She put the phone away and sat next to me for the remainder of the session. And the more she sat there, moping and motionless, the angrier I became.

So, there I was—in that moment when I was supposed to find serenity lying flat on my back.

I had this awful urge to lecture the girl right then and there ... to say what was on my mind ... to tell her how angry I was.

Instead, I prayed. I asked, "God, why me? Why can't I catch a break? Why can't you stop putting this pressure on me?"

I do not pray. Or, I should say that I rarely pray. I was raised in a religious home, but I left religion long ago. So, this sudden pleading and complaining to a higher power felt odd.

Then I tried to do what many friends have suggested whenever I've mentioned I want to try meditation. I tried to observe my thoughts. I felt that grievance I just made to God bounce and rattle around my brain. Each time it bounced it got a little quieter. I didn't touch it; nor did I try to banish it. And I felt it fade like the sound of a screaming child running down a hall away from me.

Then another thought presented itself. It was a notion from down the road. It observed me getting worked up and dropped by. It was utterly guileless, and a bit parochial, but it was also kind and concerned, in a neighborly way. It apologized for intruding but then suggested that the good lord chose me because He knew I would be the best at caring for my daughter and for dealing with situations like ... my recent predicament.

This simpleton of a brain-fart annoyed me. It lingered humbly in the forefront of my mind. It wasn't much to enamor. It had clearly spent too much time in the sun, and it didn't dress to impress. But it wouldn't go away when I ignored it. So, I let it continue.

"It's ok to get angry," it said. "I imagine you're tired. But no one can care for her like you. She chose you for that very reason."

To this, I was skeptical.

"Oh, yes," the thought replied. "She chose you. And He blessed the choice."

It confused me. I wanted to fight it. That's when I felt the tear run down my cheek. Here, in this virtual yoga class, I was losing my shit. I tried to focus on Pixie's words, to take myself back to class and ignore this spiritual twit that barged in like a lost cousin.

The thought wandered off but I sensed it telling me I could holler if I ever needed a reminder again.

I don't like to think like this. Throughout our journey, I despised when people said, "God chose her because she can take it." Those words felt cruel and they made me less inclined to entertain religion. What higher power would choose to inflict cancer upon a child?

But this thought was different from those unhelpful consolations of the past.

It made me reflect upon my time with Jordan earlier this morning--in the moments we shared before yoga class. She texted me around nine, asking if we were still going to have coffee together. I texted back an affirmative, but asked for an hour more with my newspaper. She sent me a thumbs up in reply.

At 10am, I kept my promise. When I came to her room to wake her she was already up. We stretched together. It's a routine we started last Monday. I introduced the first session to her without warning. It was a half-baked experiment. She slept late every day ... sometimes until the late afternoon. It worried me. Was she getting enough to eat? Was this depression? Was cancer returning?

So, Monday I made a plan to get her up. This can be a dangerous endeavor with Jordan. She does not take kindly to unplanned wake-up calls. But she takes one of her medications at 10am and I decided to add something extra when she downed the pill. I asked her to try a few stretches with me. She was not amused.

"Dad, let me sleep," she whined.

But I told her I would only leave and let her sleep if she would do a few stretches with me. "You won't even have to get out of bed," I said. Reluctantly, she complied.

We reached for the ceiling. Then I had her fold forward and touch her toes. Finally, we circled our arms forward and backward. When it was done, I said, "that's all. You can sleep now." She dropped back onto her pillow and I quietly exited.

I hoped it would get her circulation going; that the tiny bit of movement would cue her body to wake. To hedge my bet, I left a cup of coffee at her bedside. She loves coffee. It was my backup plan.

A half hour later she called for me. When I came in she said, "you told me not to drink coffee on an empty stomach." So, I made her breakfast.

She started her day at 11am that day. A victory! My diabolical plan worked. So, I did it again on Tuesday. And she was up and going by 10:30. Wednesday, she actually texted me shortly after 10am because I hadn't come for her yet. "We need to do our stretches," she said.

After we stretched today, I made her an egg-in-the-hole. I shaved a little Parmesan into the pan because it is her favorite. And she ate it all. We enjoyed two cups of coffee together. And then it was time for me to do yoga.

Maybe it was the contrast between the warm beginning and the disruptive middle of this morning that made me angry. But I cried when I realized she and I ... and all of us in this house are so very lucky. It is a house brimful with love. Each of us does little things every day to show care and gratitude. This journey with cancer is accompanied by plenty of aggravation. But that bumpkin of a thought that interrupted my tantrum was correct. No one can care for her like me and Jeanette. And I wouldn't want anyone else to have that privilege.]]></content:encoded>
